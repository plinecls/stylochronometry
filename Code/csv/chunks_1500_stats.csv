(note this important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: when a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily remain optional. in many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves forced to use it.) while technological progress as a whole continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new technical advance considered by itself appears to be desirable. electricity, indoor plumbing, rapid long-distance communications ... how could one argue against any of these things, or against any other of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern society? it would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone, for example. it offered many advantages and no disadvantages. yet, as we explained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together have created a world in which the average man’s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in those of politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence. the same process will continue in the future. take genetic engineering, for example. few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease. it does no apparent harm and prevents much suffering. yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free creation of chance (or of god, or whatever, depending on your religious beliefs). another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that, within the context of a given society, technological progress marches in only one direction; it can never be reversed. once a technical innovation has been introduced, people usually become dependent on it, so that they can never again do without it, unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation. not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes dependent on it. (imagine what would happen to the system today if computers, for example, were eliminated.) thus the system can move in only one direction, toward greater technologization. technology repeatedly forces freedom to take a step back, but technology can never take a step back -- short of the overthrow of the whole technological system. technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many different points at the same time (crowding, rules and regulations, increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations, propaganda and other psychological techniques, genetic engineering, invasion of privacy through surveillance devices and computers, etc.). to hold back any one of the threats to freedom would require a long and difficult social struggle. those who want to protect freedom are overwhelmed by the sheer number of new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop, hence they become apathetic and no longer resist. to fight each of the threats separately would be futile. success can be hoped for only by fighting the technological system as a whole; but that is revolution, not reform. technicians (we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who perform a specialized task that requires training) tend to be so involved in their work (their surrogate activity) that when a conflict arises between their technical work and freedom, they almost always decide in favor of their technical work. this is obvious in the case of scientists, but it also appears elsewhere: educators humanitarian groups, conservation organizations do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological techniques to help them achieve their laudable ends. corporations and government agencies, when they find it useful, do not hesitate to collect information about individuals without regard to their privacy. law enforcement agencies are frequently inconvenienced by the constitutional rights of suspects and often of completely innocent persons, and they do whatever they can do legally (or sometimes illegally) to restrict or circumvent those rights. most of these educators, government officials and law officers believe in freedom, privacy and constitutional rights, but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is more important. it is well known that people generally work better and more persistently when striving for a reward than when attempting to avoid a punishment or negative outcome. scientists and other technicians are motivated mainly by the rewards they get through their work. but those who oppose technological invasions of freedom are working to avoid a negative outcome, consequently there are few who work persistently and well at this discouraging task. if reformers ever achieved a signal victory that seemed to set up a solid barrier against further erosion of freedom through technical progress, most would tend to relax and turn their attention to more agreeable pursuits. but the scientists would remain busy in their laboratories, and technology as it progresses would find ways, in spite of any barriers, to exert more and more control over individuals and make them always more dependent on the system. no social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. history shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. but technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. still, the technology would remain waiting. sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom. and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. a few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers",21.43

""[e]very .. . bureaucracy develops a tendency to preserve itself, to fatten itself parasitically. it also develops a tendency to become a power in and of itself, autonomous, over which governments lose all real control."" a nation's military establishment often acquires a considerable degree of autonomy and then supplants the government as the dominant political force in the country. nowadays the undisguised military coup seems less popular than it once was, and politically sophisticated generals prefer to exercise their power behind the scenes while allowing a facade of civilian government to function. when the generals find it necessary to intervene overtly they claim to be acting in favor of "" democracy"" or some such ideal. this type of military dominance can be seen today in pakistan and egypt. two competing, entirely legal self-prop systems that have arisen in the u.s. during the last few decades are the politically correct left and the dogmatic right (not to be confused with the liberals and conservatives of earlier times in america). this book is not the place to speculate about the outcome of the struggle between these two forces; suffice it to say that in the long run their bitter conflict may do more to prevent the establishment of a lastingly peaceful world order than all the bombs of al qeeda and all the murders of the mexican drug gangs. people who find it difficult to face harsh realities will hope for a way to design and construct a world-system in which the processes that lead to destructive competition will not occur. but in chapter one we've explained why no such project can ever be successfully carried out in practice. it may be objected that a mammal (or other complex biological organism) is a self-prop system that is a composite of millions of other self-prop systems, namely, the cells of its own body. yet (unless and until the animal gets cancer) no destructive competition arises among cells or groups of cells within the animal's body. instead, all the cells loyally serve the interests of the animal as a whole. moreover, no external threat to the animal is necessary to keep the cells faithful to their duty. there is (it may be argued) no reason why the world-system could not be as well organized as the body of a mammal, so that no destructive competition would arise among its self-prop subsystems. but the body of a mammal is a product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution through natural selection. this means that it has been created through a process of trial and error involving many millions of successive trials. if we suppose the duration of a generation to be a period of time d, those members of the first generation that contributed to the second generation by producing offspring were only those that passed the test of selection over time d. those lineages that survived to the third generation were only those that passed the test of selection over time 2d. those lineages that survived to the fourth generation were only those that passed the test of selection over time 3d. and so forth. those lineages that survived to the nth generation were only those that passed the test of selection over the time-interval (n-l)d as well as the test of selection over every shorter time-interval. though the foregoing explanation is grossly simplified, it shows that in order to have survived up to the present, a lineage of organisms has to have passed the test of selection many millions of times and over all time-intervals, short, medium, and long. to put it another way, the lineage has had to pass through a series of many millions of filters, each of which has allowed the passage only of those lineages that were ""fittest"" (in the darwinian sense) to survive over time-intervals of widely varying length. it is only through this process that the body of a mammal has evolved, with its incredibly subtle and complex mechanisms that promote the survival of the animal's lineage at short, medium, and long term. these mechanisms include those that prevent destructive competition among cells or groups of cells within the animal's body. also highly important is the large number of individuals in each generation of a biological organism. a species that has had a close brush with extinction may at some point have been reduced to a few thousand individuals, but any mammalian species, through almost all of its evolutionary history since its first appearance as a multi-celled organism, has had millions of individuals in each generation from among which the ""fittest"" have been selected. but once self-propagating systems have attained global scale, two crucial differences emerge. the first difference is in the number of individuals from among which the "" fittest"" are selected. self-prop systems sufficiently big and powerful to be plausible contenders for global dominance will probably number in the dozens, or possibly in the hundreds; they certainly will not number in the millions. with so few individuals from among which to select the ""fittest,"" it seems safe to say that the process of natural selection will be inefficient in promoting the fitness for survival of the dominant global self-prop systems. it should also be noted that among biological organisms, species that consist of a relatively small number of large individuals are more vulnerable to extinction than species that consist of a large number of small individuals. though the analogy between biological organisms and self-propagating systems of human beings is far from perfect, still the prospect for viability of a world-system based on the dominance of a few global self-prop systems does not look encouraging. the second difference is that in the absence of rapid, worldwide transportation and communication, the breakdown or the destructive action of a small-scale self-prop system has only local repercussions. outside the limited zone where such a self-prop system has been active there will be other self-prop systems among which the process of evolution through natural selection will continue. but where rapid, worldwide transportation and communication have led to the emergence of global self-prop systems, the breakdown or the destructive action of any one such system can shake the whole world-system. consequently, in the process of trial and error that is evolution through natural selection, it is highly probable that after only a relatively small number of""trials"" resulting in ""errors,"" the world-system will break down or will be so severely disrupted that none of the world's larger or more complex self-prop systems will be able",28.85

when attempting to avoid a punishment or negative outcome. scientists and other technicians are motivated mainly by the rewards they get through their work. but those who oppose technological invasions of freedom are working to avoid a negative outcome, consequently there are few who work persistently and well at this discouraging task. if reformers ever achieved a signal victory that seemed to set up a solid barrier against further erosion of freedom through technical progress, most would tend to relax and turn their attention to more agreeable pursuits. but the scientists would remain busy in their laboratories, and technology as it progressed would find ways, in spite of any barriers, to exert more and more control over individuals and make them always more dependent on the system. 133. no social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. history shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. but technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangement that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. still, the technology would remain, waiting. sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. a few years ago it seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least some of the worst forms of environmental degradation. a change in the political wind, and those barriers begin to crumble. 134. for all of the foregoing reasons, technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom. but this statement requires an important qualification. it appears that during the next several decades the industrial-technological system will be undergoing severe stresses due to economic and environmental problems, and especially due to problems of human behavior (alienation, rebellion, hostility, a variety of social and psychological difficulties). we hope that the stresses through which the system is likely to pass will cause it to break down, or at least will weaken it sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes possible. if such a revolution occurs and is successful, then at that particular moment the aspiration for freedom will have proved more powerful than technology. 135. in paragraph 125 we used an analogy of a weak neighbor who is left destitute by a strong neighbor who takes all his land by forcing on him a series of compromises. but suppose now that the strong neighbor gets sick, so that he is unable to defend himself. the weak neighbor can force the strong one to give him his land back, or he can kill him. if he lets the strong man survive and only forces him to give the land back, he is a fool, because when the strong man gets well he will again take all the land for himself. the only sensible alternative for the weaker man is to kill the strong one while he has the chance. in the same way, while the industrial system is sick we must destroy it. if we compromise with it and let it recover from its sickness, it will eventually wipe out all of our freedom. 136. if anyone still imagines that it would be possible to reform the system in such a way as to protect freedom from technology, let him consider how clumsily and for the most part unsuccessfully our society has dealt with other social problems that are far more simple and straightforward. among other things, the system has failed to stop environmental degradation, political corruption, drug trafficking or domestic abuse. 137. take our environmental problems, for example. here the conflict of values is straightforward: economic expedience now versus saving some of our natural resources for our grandchildren. but on this subject we get only a lot of blather and obfuscation from the people who have power, and nothing like a clear, consistent line of action, and we keep on piling up environmental problems that our grandchildren will have to live with. attempts to resolve the environmental issue consist of struggles and compromises between diff erent factions, some of which are ascendant at one moment, others at another moment. the line of struggle changes with the shifting currents of public opinion. this is not a rational process, nor is it one that is likely to lead to a timely and successful solution to the problem. major social problems, if they get ""solved"" at all, are rarely or never solved through any rational, comprehensive plan. they just work themselves out through a process in which various competing groups pursuing their own (usually short-term) self-interest arrive (mainly by luck) at some more or less stable modus vivendi. in fact, the principles we formulated in paragraphs 100-106 make it seem doubtful that rational, long-term social planning can ever be successful. 138. thus it is clear that the human race has at best a very limited capacity for solving even relatively straightforward social problems. how then is it going to solve the far more difficult and subtle problem of reconciling freedom with technology? technology presents clear-cut material advantages, whereas freedom is an abstraction that means diff erent things to different people, and its loss is easily obscured by propaganda and fancy talk. 139. and note this important difference: it is conceivable that our environmental problems (for example) may some day be settled through a rational, comprehensive plan, but if this happens it will be only because it is in the long-term interest of the system to solve these problems. but it is not in the interest of the system to preserve freedom or small-group autonomy. on the contrary, it is in the interest of the system to bring human behavior under control to the greatest possible extent. thus, while practical considerations may eventually force the system to take a rational, prudent approach to environmental problems, equally practical considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior ever more closely (pref erably by indirect means that will disguise the encroachment on freedom). this isn't just our opinion. eminent social scientists (e.g., james wilson) have stressed the importance of ""socializing"" people more effectively. 140. we hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in such a way as to reconcile freedom with technology. the only way out is to dispense with the industrial-technological system altogether. this implies revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature of society. 141. people tend to assume that because a revolution involves a much greater change than reform does, it is more difficult to bring about than reform is. actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than reform. the reason is that a revolutionary movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire. a reform movement merely offers to solve a particular social problem. a revolutionary movement offers to solve all problems at one stroke and create a whole new world; it provides the kind of ideal for which people will take great risks and make great sacrifices. for this reason it would be much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to put effective, permanent restraints on the development or application of anyone segment of technology, such as genetic engineering, for example. not many people will devote themselves with single-minded passion to imposing and maintaining restraints on genetic engineering, but under suitable conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves passionately to a revolution against the industrial- technological system. as we noted in paragraph 132, reformers seeking to limit certain aspects of technology would be working to avoid a negative outcome. but revolutionaries work to gain a powerful reward — fulfillment of their revolutionary vision — and therefore work harder and more persistently than reformers do. 142. reform is always restrained by the fear of painful consequences if changes go too far. but once a revolutionary fever has taken hold of a society, people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships for the sake of their revolution. this was clearly shown in the french and russian revolutions. it may be that in such cases only a minority of the population is really committed to the revolution, but this minority is sufficiently large and active so that it becomes the dominant force in society. we will have more to say about revolution in paragraphs 180-205. 143. since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to put pressures on human beings for the sake of the functioning of the social organism. the kinds of

(everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) the fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. we call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44). 34. consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. at first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. eventually he may become clinically depressed. history shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent.fhis is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. but leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. this shows that power is not enough. one must have goals toward which to exercise one's power. 35. everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. but the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. hence his boredom and demoralization. 36. non-attainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if non-attainment of the goals is compatible with survival. consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression. 37. thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals. 38. but not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. for example, the emperor hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. when people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves. in many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. thus the aristocrats of the roman empire had their literary pretensions; many european aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn't need the meat; other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like hirohito, have turned to science. 39. we use the term ""surrogate activity"" to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or, let us say, merely for the sake of the ""fulfillment"" that they get from pursuing the goal. here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal x, ask yourself this: if he had to devote most of hi; time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal x? if the answer is no, then the person's pursuit of a goal x is a surrogate activity. hirohito's studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn't know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. on the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (but pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.) 40. in modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one's physical needs. it is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. the only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple obedience. if one has those, society' takes care of one from cradle to grave. (yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. these include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in the case",21.74

(nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) more reasonably, it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like china, vietnam and north korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world. that is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. true, there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at approximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators. that is a risk that has to be taken. and it is worth taking, since the difference between a “democratic” industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one. it might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable, because dictator-controlled systems usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break down. look at cuba. revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the world economy into a unified whole. free trade agreements like nafta and gatt are probably harmful to the environment in the short run, but in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence between nations. it will be easier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so unified that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead to its breakdown in all industrialized nations. some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. at best these people are expressing themselves unclearly, because they fail to distinguish between power for large organizations and power for individuals and small groups. it is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people need power. modern man as a collective entity -- that is, the industrial system -- has immense power over nature, and we (fc) regard this as evil. but modern individuals and small groups of individuals have far less power than primitive man ever did. generally speaking, the vast power of “modern man” over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. to the extent that the average modern individual can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (you need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) the individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. his personal power over nature is slight. primitive individuals and small groups actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power within nature. when primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. he knew how to protect himself from heat cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. but primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the collective power of primitive society was negligible compared to the collective power of industrial society. instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the industrial system should be broken, and that this will greatly increase the power and freedom of individuals and small groups. until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked, the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries’ only goal. other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal. more importantly if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology, they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal. if they give in to that temptation, they will fall right back into the technological trap, because modern technology is a unified, tightly organized system, so that, in order to retain some technology, one finds oneself obliged to retain most technology, hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology. suppose for example that the revolutionaries took “social justice” as a goal. human nature being what it is, social justice would not come about spontaneously; it would have to be enforced. in order to enforce it the revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control. for that they would need rapid long-distance transportation and communication, and therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and communication systems. to feed and clothe poor people they would have to use agricultural and manufacturing technology. and so forth. so that the attempt to insure social justice would force them to retain most parts of the technological system. not that we have anything against social justice, but it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system. it would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system without using some modern technology. if nothing else they must use the communications media to spread their message. but they should use modern technology for only one purpose: to attack the technological system. imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. suppose he starts saying to himself, “wine isn’t bad for you if used in moderation. why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you! it won’t do me any harm if i take just one little drink....” well you know what is going to happen. never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine. revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. there is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent inherited. no one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of a person’s genetic constitution, but it appears that personality traits are partly inherited and that certain personality traits tend, within the context of our society, to make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude. objections to these findings have been raised, but the objections are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated. in any event, no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes similar to those of their parents. from our point of view it doesn’t matter all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically or through childhood training. in either case they are passed on. the trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against the industrial system are also concerned about the population problems, hence they are apt to have few or no children. in this way they may be handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept the industrial system. to insure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation should reproduce itself abundantly. in doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly. and the important problem is to get rid of the industrial system, because once the industrial system is gone the world’s population necessarily will decrease (see paragraph 167); whereas, if the industrial system survives, it will continue developing new techniques of food production that may enable the world’s population to keep increasing almost indefinitely. with regard to revolutionary strategy, the only points on which we absolutely insist are that the single overriding goal must be the elimination of modern technology, and that no other goal can be allowed to compete with this one. for the rest, revolutionaries should take an empirical approach. if experience indicates that some of the recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good results, then those recommendations should be discarded. an argument likely to be raised against our proposed revolution is that it is bound to fail, because (it is claimed) throughout history technology has always progressed, never regressed, hence technological regression is impossible. but this claim is false. we distinguish between two kinds of technology, which we will call small-scale technology and organization-dependent technology. small-scale technology is technology that can be used by small-scale communities without outside assistance. organization-dependent technology is technology that depends on large-scale social organization. we are aware of no significant cases of regression in small-scale technology. but organization-dependent technology does regress when the social organization on which it depends breaks down. example: when the roman empire fell apart the romans’ small-scale technology survived because any clever village craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith could make steel by roman methods, and",20.83

so is the drive for power. moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. for example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. but leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. helping black people is not their real goal. instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. in doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred. if our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to invent problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss. we emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. it is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism. psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. a person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. it may seem senseless to say that many leftists are over-socialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. nevertheless, the position can be defended. many leftists are not such rebels as they seem. the moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. for example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. in order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a nonmoral origin. we use the term “oversocialized” to describe such people. oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. one of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society’s expectations. if this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of himself. moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society’s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. the majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. they lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. the oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. the oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think “unclean” thoughts. and socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. in many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. we suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human being inflict on one another. we argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. notice that university intellectuals constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most leftwing segment. the leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. but usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. generally speaking, the goals of today’s leftists are not in conflict with the accepted morality. on the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. more fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. all these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes for a long time. these values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles. here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society",20.83

today are called "" democratic."" but democratic government is at least a much clearer objective than such vague goals as ""freedom,"" ""equality,"" ""justice,"" ""socialism,"" or ""protecting the environment."" from the history of many countries scattered around the world we know how reversible the achievement of democracy can be. the overthrow of a democratic government through a military coup was once such a common event in latin america and africa that news of such a coup hardly raised an eyebrow in western europe or the united states. a military coup usually represents not the corruption of democracy but a victory of those who never wanted democracy in the first place. but the death of a democracy through corruption (in our sense of the word) has probably been even more common than the military coup, and when this happens the external forms of democracy often are retained even while an individual or an oligarchy takes effective control of the country. we've seen this in russia since the breakup of the soviet union: vladimir putin was originally a protege of boris yeltsin, the great champion of russian democracy, and russia still retains all the usual apparatus of parliamentary democracy. yet it is said that putin is now almost a dictator. in latin america, democracy has routinely been corrupted. a group of argentine scholars presents the following example as typical: the center of gravity of control passed softly and silently from the state to a restricted economic and social apparatus (inside groups) that constituted a privileged system of enrichment. the acquisition of a license for importation or for exchange made more men rich in less time than any other activity, including speculation in land. this is how the families dominant in the financial sector entered political channels . . . . there occurred a metamorphosis of the 'group of families,' which, incidentally allied for the purpose of negotiating with the state . . . turned into a stable, indissolubly united oligarchy for the organisms of political activity .. . in the parties, in the government .. . and in order to establish a system of privilege. a democratic government can easily be subverted because it is a complicated mechanism and the concept of ""democracy"" itself is far from precise, so that subtle or covert changes can accumulate over time until one day people wake up to find that their country is no longer a functioning democracy. compare democracy with the clear and simple achievements of the feminists and the irish nationalists-the right to vote and political independence for ireland, respectively. because of the clarity and simplicity of these achievements, they could not easily be undermined covertly. note, however, that while impairment of ireland's formal political independence would be obvious, ireland could become dependent on britain economically or in some other way. though the establishment of democratic government has so often been a reversible social change, it cannot be said that democratization per se is reversible. whether it is reversible or irreversible in a given case depends on the culture and history of the country in which the democratic government is set up, and on the international situation in which the country finds itself. the more or less democratic system set up by the american revolutionaries survived despite the fading of revolutionary idealism, in part because the american colonists had already been long habituated to a semi-democratic form of government. today in latin america functioning democratic governments seem to have a better chance of success than they did a few decades ago, probably because the cultural and economic changes associated with modernization have raised the level of social discipline in those countries. another factor to be considered is that the international climate has become more unfavorable to obvious dictatorships (by an individual or by a party), and nations are now under pressure to maintain at least the appearance of democracy. in africa, for example, international aid organizations left the gambia after a military coup in 1994 but resumed assistance to that country following its return to democratic forms; assistance to tanzania from the international monetary fund apparently was conditioned on political reforms in 1986; in kenya, ""western financial aid came to be tied to demands for political and economic reforms,"" so that in 1991 there was a ""constitutional amendment that reinstated multiparty elections."" on the other hand, it must seriously be doubted whether democracy is a functioning reality i n those countries. kenya,105 at least, is not a democracy in the sense in which that term is understood in western europe and the united states. as the foregoing discussion indicates, the problem of predicting whether a social change will be reversible or irreversible in a given case can be subtle and difficult. consequently, rule (ii) may often be hard to apply in practice. rule (ii) is important nevertheless. the essential point of the rule is that a movement builds its foundation on quicksand ifit bases its strategy on the assumption that faithfulness to the movement's ideals will be sustained indefinitely and independently of the immediate self-interest of the people who are in positions of power. what a nascent movement needs to ask itself in choosing its objective is whether the resulting social changes, once achieved, will survive in an atmosphere in which people are motivated more by short-term self-interest than by dedication to idealswhich indeed is the normal atmosphere in any society. even though this question may often be difficult to answer with any degree of confidence, it needs to be asked and considered carefully. rule (iii) states that once an objective has been selected, some small minority must undertake organization for practical action (as opposed to mere preaching or advocacy of ideas) in the service of the objective. three points must be noted, however: first, while ideas by themselves will not transform a society, the development and propagation of ideas must be a part of any rational effort to transform a society. without some organized set ofideas to guide its action, a movement will flounder aimlessly. it may generate more or less uproar, but if it accomplishes anything more than that it will do so merely through luck. the whiteboy movement of 18th-century ireland consisted of guerrilla-like peasant bands that roamed the countryside at night taking revenge on the landlords and on those peasants who were too ready to cooperate with the landlords. but the members of these bands were uneducated men whose limited ideas did not enable them to envision anything beyond resistance to specific local abuses. only in the 1790s, with the arrival of ideas from revolutionary france, did the irish peasant rebels begin to acquire some notion of changing society. at the time of the attempted revolution of 1798 their ideas in this direction were still too confused to provide them with a clear objective, and their lack of a clear objective was probably a contributing factor in their defeat. contrast the irish peasants of 1798 with the workers of saint petersburg who revolted in february 1917: these workers had already been indoctrinated with marxist ideas by the bolsheviks, consequently their insurrection was purposeful and successful. second, while both ideas and organization for practical action are necessary components of any rational and successful effort to change a society, the people who organize for practical action need not be the same individuals as the theorists who develop and propagate the ideas. in ireland, again, nationalist ideas and the aspiration for independence from britain were already well developed among the extremist minority prior to the advent of michael collins in 1917. collins does not seem to have been a theorist, but it was he who organized the successful guerrilla war that led to ireland's independence in 1922. however, for theorists who do not themselves organize for practical action, there is a grave danger: the men of action who do organize, purportedly in the service of the theorists' ideas, may reinterpret or distort the ideas so that the results are very different from what the theorists envisioned. martin luther was appalled at the social rebellion that his ideas called forth, and we've already pointed out that marxist revolutionaries like lenin, trotsky, stalin, mao, and castro deviated from marx's ideas whenever they found it convenient to do so. here again we see the importance of rule (i), that is, of the need to select a clear, simple, concrete objective: neither marx nor luther formulated such an objective, and because their ideas were complex their ideas could easily be misunderstood or distorted. in contrast, by the time michael collins assumed leadership of the irish nationalist movement, the nationalists had already settled on total political independence from britain as their central objective-an objective of such clarity and simplicity that it could hardly be misunderstood or distorted. third, preaching, or the advocacy of ideas, is by far the easier part of an effort to change a society; organizing for practical action is vastly more difficult. this at least is true today; it may not always have been",27.27

""having subjugated his own will to the movement, he was determined that others should do so too."" but it has to be conceded that in practical terms the theory is not as democratic as it sounds. first, many decisions will need to be made quickly, with no time for discussion by the rank and file. the organization will have to have some sort of executive body that is empowered to make such decisions, and the rank and file will have to obey the decisions so made. second, even when there is sufficient time, the organization can't be effective if many decisions are made by a simple head-count, so many votes on one side, so many on the other. however offensive it may be to our democratic sensibilities, the plain truth is that some individuals will have vastly more knowledge and experience relevant to the functioning of the organization than others will. every member of the organization should be listened to, but the main responsibility for decision-making will have to rest with a relatively small group of leaders comprising those members who are best informed and have the highest level of political and organizational skill. thus, an effective revolutionary organization will require a significant measure of hierarchy and discipline. the so-called ""democratic"" countries in today's world are in reality governed by political parties. in even the most democratic of these parties, decisions are made primarily by a limited inner circle ofleaders who pay only as much attention as they think expedient to the opinions of the rank and file. a close approximation to true democracy can exist only in societies organized on a very small scale, such as the nomadic bands of african pygmies.104 in any modern, large-scale society, a political organization that attempts to maintain a truly democratic internal structure will condemn itself to impotence. 19. recognition of the importance of unity might lead to an erroneous conclusion, namely, that a revolutionary organization should never split when there are disagreements over principles, strategy, or tactics. of course, a faction shouldn't split from its parent organization for slight reasons or while there is a good prospect of resolving disagreements through discussion, or when there is an acute, immediate need to present a united front against adversaries. but an organization cannot be truly unified when there is within it a persistent, irreconcilable disagreement over a question of far-reaching importance. if such a disagreement develops among the members of a revolutionary organization, and if there is no apparent likelihood of resolving the disagreement within a reasonable time, it will usually be best if the dissident minority separates itself from the parent group. this will leave the parent group and the minority each with its own independent unity. if the minority is wrong it presumably will remain weak, while the parent group leads the revolution. on the other hand, if the minority's view is proven right through practice, then the minority can be expected to assume leadership when the time is ripe and leave its parent organization in the dust. lenin said, ""we must not be afraid to be a minority,"" and he never hesitated to act accordingly when he was sure he was right. trotsky makes clear that lenin always insisted on pursuing his own line no matter what the rest of the bolsheviks thought. lenin preferred to be a member of a small minority that was right rather than compromise his views in order to get broader support. thus he and his bolsheviks, though they constituted a minority within the social democratic party, split from their rivals, the mensheviks (effectively in 1903, formally in 1912) and took their own road. because their road turned out to be the right one, they eventually prevailed over the mensheviks. again, at the outbreak of world war i in 1914, lenin adopted and maintained an anti-war position and even advocated ""transforming the imperialist war into civil war,"" despite the fact that he was supported in this only by his ""closest comrades,"" who comprised ""a minority within the group of anti-war socialists, who, in turn, constituted a small minority of the international socialist movement .. . . "" lenin and his minority prevailed in the end because their judgment of the political situation had been better than that of other socialists. when lenin announced his ""april theses"" in the spring of 1917 these were met with hostility by the other bolshevik leaders, who thought he was ""temporarily disorientated."" lenin persisted, however, and in this case he did succeed after several weeks in bringing the rest of the party over to his view. much the same thing happened in october of that year when, at first against the opposition of the majority of the bolshevik leaders but eventually with success, lenin advocated the insurrection that put the bolsheviks in control of russia. lenin won out in these conflicts only because his political judgment was better than that of his opponents. if his opponents had advocated more effective policies, they would have prevailed in the end and lenin would have sunk into obscurity. lenin of course was a political genius, so he could afford to be confident to the point of arrogance in his political judgments. those of us who are not equally gifted should be more cautious about risking a split in a revolutionary movement. nevertheless, when it has become clear that there are deep and irreconcilable disagreements between different factions, it will generally be advisable for a movement to split. 20. a revolutionary movement needs to be self-confident. alinsky, in explaining the techniques he had used throughout his long and successful career as a social and political activist, emphasized that a community organizer had to have confidence in himself and had to instill confidence in the people he was organizing. as long as people lacked confidence in their own power to bring about great changes they remained passive and apathetic, but once they were imbued with a sense of their own power they could become energetic, active, and effective. trotsky noted the significance of the fact that the bolsheviks ""believed in",23.44

""the laws proved futile, however, and aristocratic landowning and political dominance continued to grow."" simon bolivar was the principal leader of the revolutions through which spain's american colonies achieved their independence. he had hoped and expected to establish stable and ""enlightened"" government throughout spanish america, but he made so little progress toward that objective that he wrote in bitterness shortly before his death in 1830: ""he who serves a revolution plows the sea."" bolivar went on to predict that spanish america would ""infallibly fall into the hands of the unrestrained multitude to pass afterward to those of .. . petty tyrants of all races and colors . . . [we will be] devoured by all crimes and extinguished by ferocity [so that] the europeans will not deign to conquer us . . . . ""allowing for a good deal of exaggeration attributable to the emotion under which bolivar wrote, this prediction held (roughly) true for a century and a half after his death. but notice that bolivar did not arrive at this prediction until too late; and that it was a very general prediction that asserted nothing specific. in the united states during the late 19th century there were worker-housing projects sponsored by a number of individual philanthropists and housing reformers. their objective was to show that efforts to improve the living conditions of workers could be combined with . . . profits of 5 percent annually . . . . reformers believed that the model dwellings would set a standard that other landlords would be forced to meet . . . mostly because of the workings of competition. unfortunately, this solution to the housing problem did not take hold . . . . the great mass of urban workers . . . were crowded into . . . tenements that operated solely for profit. it is not apparent that there has been any progress over the centuries in the capacity of humans to guide the development of their societies. relatively recent (post-1950) efforts in this direction may seem superficially to be more sophisticated than those of earlier times, but they do not appear to be more successful. the social reform programs of the mid-1960s in the united states, spearheaded by president lyndon johnson, revealed that beliefs about the causes and cures of such social problems as crime, drug abuse, poverty, and slums had little validity. for example, according to one disappointed reformer: once upon a time we thought that if we could only get our problem families out of those dreadful slums, then papa would stop taking dope, mama would stop chasing around, and junior would stop carrying a knife. well, we've got them in a nice new apartment with modern kitchens and a recreation center. and they're the same bunch of bastards they always were. this doesn't mean that all of the reform programs were total failures, but the general level of success was so low as to indicate that the reformers did not understand the workings of society well enough to know what should be done to solve the social problems that they addressed. where they achieved some modest level of success they probably did so mainly through luck. one could go on and on citing examples like the foregoing ones. one could also cite many examples of efforts to control the development of societies in which the immediate goals of the efforts have been achieved. but in such cases the longer-term consequences for society as a whole have not been what the reformers or revolutionaries have expected or desired. the legislation of the athenian statesman solon (6th century bc) was intended to abolish hektemorage (roughly equivalent to serfdom) in attica while allowing the aristocracy to retain most of its wealth and privilege. in this respect the legislation was successful. but it also had unexpected consequences that solon surely would not have approved. the liberation of the ""serfs"" resulted in a labor shortage that led the athenians to purchase or capture numerous slaves from outside attica, so that athens was transformed into a slave society. another indirect consequence of solon's legislation was the peisistratid ""tyranny"" (populist dictatorship) that ruled athens during a substantial part of the 6th century bc. otto von bismarck, one of the most brilliant statesmen in european history, had an impressive list of successes to his credit. among other things: -he achieved the unification of germany in 1867-1871. -he engineered the franco-prussian war of 1870-71, but his successful efforts for peace thereafter earned him the respect of european leaders. -he successfully promoted the industrialization of germany. -by such means he won for the monarchy the support of the middle class. -thus bismarck achieved his most important objective: he prevented (temporarily) the democratization of germany. -though bismarck was forced to resign in 1890, the political structure he had established for germany lasted until 1918, when it was brought down by the german defeat in world war 1. notwithstanding his remarkable successes bismarck felt that he had failed, and in 1898 he died an embittered old man.14 clearly, germany was not going the way he had intended. probably it was the resumption of germany's slow drift toward democratization that angered him most. but his bitterness would have been deeper if he had foreseen the future. one can only speculate as to what the history of germany might have been after 1890 if bismarck hadn't led the country up to that date, but it is certain that he did not succeed in putting germany on a course leading to results of which he would have approved; for bismarck would have been horrified by the disastrous war of 1914-18, by germany's defeat in it, and above all by the subsequent rise of adolf hitler. in the united states, reformers' zeal led to the enactment in 1919 of ""prohibition"" (prohibition of the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic",18.08

it would be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking, as was done before the invention of the refrigerator. so it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken down, refrigeration technology would quickly be lost. the same is true of other organization-dependent technology. and once this technology had been lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild it, just as it took centuries to build it the first time around. surviving technical books would be few and scattered. an industrial society, if built from scratch without outside help, can only be built in a series of stages: you need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools ... . a long process of economic development and progress in social organization is required. and, even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology, there is no reason to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial society. the enthusiasm for “progress” is a phenomenon peculiar to the modern form of society, and it seems not to have existed prior to the 17th century or thereabouts. in the late middle ages there were four main civilizations that were about equally “advanced”: europe, the islamic world, india, and the far east (china, japan, korea). three of those civilizations remained more or less stable, and only europe became dynamic. no one knows why europe became dynamic at that time; historians have their theories but these are only speculation. at any rate, it is clear that rapid development toward a technological form of society occurs only under special conditions. so there is no reason to assume that a long-lasting technological regression cannot be brought about. would society eventually develop again toward an industrial-technological form? maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time. because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement, leftists or persons of similar psychological type often are unattracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and membership are not initially leftist. the resulting influx of leftish types can easily turn a non-leftist movement into a leftist one, so that leftist goals replace or distort the original goals of the movement. to avoid this, a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists. leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology. leftism is collectivist; it seeks to bind together the entire world (both nature and the human race) into a unified whole. but this implies management of nature and of human life by organized society, and it requires advanced technology. you can’t have a united world without rapid transportation and communication, you can’t make all people love one another without sophisticated psychological techniques, you can’t have a “planned society” without the necessary technological base. above all, leftism is driven by the need for power, and the leftist seeks power on a collective basis, through identification with a mass movement or an organization. leftism is unlikely ever to give up technology, because technology is too valuable a source of collective power. the anarchist too seeks power, but he seeks it on an individual or small-group basis; he wants individuals and small groups to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives. he opposes technology because it makes small groups dependent on large organizations. some leftists may seem to oppose technology, but they will oppose it only so long as they are outsiders and the technological system is controlled by non-leftists. if leftism ever becomes dominant in society, so that the technological system becomes a tool in the hands of leftists, they will enthusiastically use it and promote its growth. in doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in the past. when the bolsheviks in russia were outsiders, they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police, they advocated self-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth; but as soon as they came into power themselves, they imposed a tighter censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that had existed under the tsars, and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done. in the united states, a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities, leftist professors were vigorous proponents of academic freedom, but today, in those of our universities where leftists have become dominant, they have shown themselves ready to take away from everyone else’s academic freedom. (this is “political correctness.”) the same will happen with leftists and technology: they will use it to oppress everyone else if they ever get it under their own control. in earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type, repeatedly, have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries, as well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination, and later have double-crossed them to seize power for themselves. robespierre did this in the french revolution, the bolsheviks did it in the russian revolution, the communists did it in spain in 1938 and castro and his followers did it in cuba. given the past history of leftism, it would be utterly foolish for non-leftist revolutionaries today to collaborate with leftists. various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion. leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural being. but, for the leftist, leftism plays a psychological role much like that which religion plays for some people. the leftist needs to believe in leftism; it plays a vital role in his psychological economy. his beliefs are not easily modified by logic or facts. he has a deep conviction that leftism is morally right with a capital r, and that he has not only a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on everyone. (however, many of the people we are referring to as “leftists” do not think of themselves as leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs as leftism. we use the term “leftism” because we don’t know of any better words to designate the spectrum of related creeds that includes the feminist, gay rights, political correctness, etc., movements, and because these movements have a strong affinity with the old left. see paragraphs 227-230.) leftism is a totalitarian force. wherever leftism is in a position of power it tends to invade every private corner and force every thought into a leftist mold. in part this is because of the quasi-religious character of leftism; everything contrary to leftist beliefs represents sin. more importantly, leftism is a totalitarian force because of the leftists’ drive for power. the leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83). but no matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate activity (see paragraph 41). that is, the leftist’s real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is motivated by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal. consequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has already attained; his need for the power process leads him always to pursue some new goal. the leftist wants equal opportunities for minorities. when that is attained he insists on statistical equality of achievement by minorities. and as long as anyone harbors in some corner of his",21.13

(everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) the fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. we call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44). consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. at first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. eventually he may become clinically depressed. history shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. this is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. but leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. this shows that power is not enough. one must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power. everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. but the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. hence his boredom and demoralization. nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression. thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals. but not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. for example, the emperor hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. when people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves. in many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. thus the aristocrats of the roman empire had their literary pretensions; many european aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn’t need the meat; other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like hirohito, have turned to science. we use the term “surrogate activity” to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal. here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal x, ask yourself this: if he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal x? if the answer is no, then the person’s pursuit of goal x is a surrogate activity. hirohito’s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. on the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (but pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.) in modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one’s physical needs. it is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. the only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple obedience. if one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. these include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. these are not always pure surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some",21.74

""in some parts of the world the consequences of the green revolution have been nothing short of catastrophic. for example, in the punjab (a region lying partly in india and partly in pakistan), the green revolution has ruined ""thousands of hectares of [formerly] productive land,"" and has led to severe lowering of the water table, contamination of the water with pesticides and fertilizers, numerous cases of cancer (probably due to the contaminated water), and many suicides. ""'the green revolution has brought us only downfall,' says jarnail singh ... . 'it ruined our soil, our environment, our water table. used to be we had fairs in villages where people would come together and have fun. now we gather in medical centers.'"" from other parts of the world as well come reports of negative consequences, of varying degrees of severity, that have followed the green revolution. these consequences include economic, behavioral, and medical effects in addition to environmental damage (e.g., desertification). in 1953, u.s. president eisenhower announced an ""atoms for peace"" program according to which the nations of the world were supposed to pool nuclear information and materials under the auspices of an international agency. in 1957 the international atomic energy agency was established to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and in 1968 the united nations general assembly approved a ""non-proliferation"" treaty under which signatories agreed not to develop nuclear weapons and in return were given nuclear technology that they were supposed to use only for peaceful purposes.19the people involved in this effort should have known enough history to realize that nations generally abide by treaties only as long as they consider it in their own (usually short-term) interest to do so, which commonly is not very long. but apparently the assumption was that the nations receiving nuclear technology would be so grateful, and so happy cooperating in its peaceful application, that they would forever put aside the aspirations for power and the bitter rivalries that throughout history had led to the development of increasingly destructive weapons. this idea seems to have originated with scientists like robert oppenheimer and niels bohr who had helped to create the first atomic bomb. that physicists would come up with something so naive was only to be expected, since specialists in the physical sciences almost always are grossly obtuse about human affairs. it seems surprising, however, that experienced politicians would act upon such an idea. but then, politicians often do things for propaganda purposes and not because they really believe in them. the ""atoms for peace"" idea worked fine-for a while. some 140 nations signed the non-proliferation treaty in 1968 (others later), and nuclear technology was spread around the world. iran, in the early 1970s, was one of the countries that received nuclear technology from the u.s. and the nations receiving such technology didn't try to use it to develop nuclear weapons. not immediately, anyway. of course, we know what has happened since then. ""[h]ard-nosed politicians and diplomats [e.g., henry kissinger]. .. argue that proliferation of nuclear weapons is fast approaching a 'tipping point' beyond which it will be impossible to check their spread."" these ""veterans of america's cold-war security establishment with impeccable credentials as believers in nuclear deterrence"" now claim that such weapons ""ha[ve] become a source of intolerable risk."" and there is the inconvenient fact that the problem of safe disposal of radioactive waste from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy still has not been solved. the ""atoms for peace"" fiasco suggests that humans' capacity to control the development of their societies not only has failed to progress, but has actually retrogressed. neither solon nor bismarck would have supported anything as stupid as ""atoms for peace."" c h a p t e r o n e : pa r t i i ii. there are good reasons why humans' capacity to control the development of their societies has failed to progress. in order to control the development of a society you would have to be able to predict how the society would react to any given action you might take, and such predictions have generally proven to be highly unreliable. human societies are complex systems-technologically advanced societies are most decidedly complex-and prediction of the behavior of complex systems presents difficulties that are not contingent on the present state of our knowledge or our level of technological development. [u]nintended consequences [are] a well-known problem with the design and use of technology ... . the cause of many [unintended consequences] seems clear: the systems involved are complex, involving interaction among and feedback between many parts. any changes to such a system will cascade in ways that are difficult to predict; this is especially true when human actions are involved. problems in economics can give us some idea of how impossibly difficult it would be to predict or control the behavior of a system as complex as that of a modern human society. it is convincingly argued that a modern economy can never be rationally planned to maximize efficiency, because the task of carrying out such planning would be too overwhelmingly complex. calculation of a rational system of prices for the u.s. economy alone would require manipulation of a conservatively estimated 6xl013 (sixty trillion!) simultaneous equations. that takes into account only the economic factors involved in establishing prices and leaves out the innumerable psychological, sociological, political, etc., factors that continuously interact with the economy. even if we make the wildly improbable assumption that the behavior of our society could be predicted through the manipulation of, say, a million trillion simultaneous equations and that sufficient computing power to conduct such manipulation were available, collection of the data necessary for insertion of the appropriate numbers into the equations would be impracticable, especially since the data would have to meet impossibly high standards of precision if the predictions were expected to remain valid over any considerable interval of time. edward lorenz, a meteorologist, was the first to call widespread attention to the fact that even the most minute inaccuracy in the data provided can totally invalidate a prediction about the behavior of a complex system. this fact came to be called the ""butterfly effect"" because in 1972, at a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science, lorenz gave a talk that he titled ""predictability: does the flap of a butterfly's wings in brazil set off a tornado in texas?"" lorenz's work is said to have been the inspiration for the development of what is called ""chaos theory"" -the butterfly effect being an example of ""chaotic"" behavior. chaotic behavior is not limited to complex systems; in fact, some surprisingly simple systems can behave chaotically. the encyclopaedia britannica illustrates this with a purely mathematical example. let a and x0 be any two given numbers with 0<a<4 and 0<x0<1, and let a sequence of numbers be generated according to the formula xn+l =axn(l - xj for certain values of a, e.g., a=3. 7, the sequence behaves chaotically: in order to bring about a linear increase in the number of terms of the sequence that one can predict to a reasonable approximation, one needs to achieve an exponential improvement in the accuracy of one's estimate of xo· in other words, in order to predict the nth term of the sequence, one needs to know the value of x0 with an error not exceeding 10-kn, k a constant. this is characteristic of chaotic systems generally: any small extension of the range of prediction requires an exponential improvement in the accuracy of the data. [a]ll chaotic systems share the property that every extra place of decimals in one's knowledge of the starting point only pushes the horizon [of predictability] a small distance away. in practical terms, the horizon of predictability is an impassable barrier . ...

it inspires heroic efforts and persistence in the face of overwhelming difficulties. given such faith and commitment, a movement may achieve things that no one thought possible. above, section 10, we've given examples of tiny groups of seeming ""cranks"" who initiated successful revolutions against what appeared at the outset to be impossible odds. numerous examples can be cited-we will cite some in a moment-of groups that eventually achieved victory only because they had the self-confidence to persist in the face of defeat and even when their situation seemed hopeless. conversely, when people lack confidence in their power to achieve things they will not in fact achieve anything difficult, because no one will exert himself to the limit when he has little hope that his efforts will be rewarded with any impressive result. for the same reason it is a serious mistake to set modest goals for a revolutionary movement on the ground that such goals are ""realistic."" only a truly world-transforming goal can inspire people to accept hardship, risk, and sacrifice, and to put forth the extreme effort that will be necessary for the success of any real revolutionary movement in the world today. it follows that the goal a revolutionary movement sets itself must be nothing less than the total collapse of the technological system. the movement moreover must consistently insist that its chances of achieving that goal will be excellent if its members show a sufficient level of commitment, energy, courage, willpower, skill, and persistence. 21. an important note of clarification: the rule that a revolutionary movement should be self-confident refers to confidence in its ability to reach its ultimate goal-that of consummating the revolution. overconfidence in carrying out particular projects or operations must be carefully guarded against, because overconfidence leads to carelessness and carelessness leads to failure. that's why lenin habitually exaggerated the potential risks involved in any action and worked out his plans with meticulous care. as trotsky said, ""one must be prudent to win the right to be bold."" prudence demands that one take care not to underestimate one's adversary. underestimation of the adversary leads to overconfidence, thence to carelessness and defeat. in general, it is safer to overestimate one's adversary. such was the policy of lenin. mao emphasized that while one must have confidence in one's ability to defeat the enemy in the long run, one must never slacken one's efforts through overconfidence during the actual process of struggle: comrade mao tsetung has repeatedly pointed out: strategically, with regard to the whole, revolutionaries must despise the enemy, dare to struggle against him and dare to seize victory; at the same time, tactically, with regard to each part, each specific struggle, they must take the enemy seriously, be prudent, carefully study and perfect the art of struggle . . . . in line with this, it should be understood that the rule that a revolutionary movement must have an ambitious, world-transforming goal refers only to the movement's ultimate goal. the movement's subsidiary goals-the goals that are steps on the way to the ultimate goal-should be prudently and carefully selected. mao advised, ""fight no battle you are not sure of winning."" mao apparently was thinking primarily of a military situation, but whether in a military or in any other situation, his advice would be impractical if taken in a strictly literal sense. seldom can one be really sure of success in any enterprise. however, in contemplating any project or action, revolutionaries should cautiously balance the advantages to be gained through success against the risk of defeat. trotsky pointed out: ""every defeat . . . changes [the correlation of forces] . . . to the disadvantage of the vanquished, for the victor gains in self-confidence and the vanquished loses faith in himself."" the hard core of a revolutionary movement needs to have the confidence, the commitment, and the psychological toughness to recover from repeated defeats and carry on in spite of them. but even the most deeply committed revolutionaries are, after all, human, and may be weakened by defeats or failures. therefore one should risk a defeat or a failure only when there is a strong reason for doing so. 22. the negative effect of defeats will be mitigated if revolutionaries understand that, following a crushing defeat that seems to leave a group in a hopeless situation, a determined renewal of effort by whatever is left of the group very often leads to victory. in a surprise attack at midwinter, 877-78 , danish vikings seized control ofwessex, the country of the west saxons. believing that resistance was futile, the saxons submitted to the invaders, but their king, alfred, escaped with a few followers to the woods and moors of somerset, and by easter 878 he had established himself in a fort on an island in the somerset marshes. at some point, either before or after he reached the marshes, alfred collected a small army, and from the fort his men harassed the danes with guerrilla attacks. about the middle of may alfred summoned saxon warriors from neighboring parts of wessex and marched with them against the danes, whom he defeated decisively at the battle of edington. alfred's ""memory lived on through the middle ages and in legend as that of a king who won victory in apparently hopeless circumstances."" even more impressive is the case of robert bruce. toward the end of the 13th century, edward i of england occupied scotland and made it into something like an english colony. the scots were restive under english rule, and in 1306 robert bruce, whose ancestry gave him a claim to the kingship, had himself inaugurated as king of scotland. but within three months he was defeated in battle by the forces of edward i and became a hunted fugitive, forced at times to survive under conditions of the greatest hardship. at this stage his cause seemed hopeless. he had hardly any money or troops, and the weakness of his position was ""almost ludicrous."" nevertheless, over the succeeding years bruce waged a savage guerrilla campaign, gradually increasing the territory he controlled and the number of his followers until, in 1314, he defeated the english decisively at the battle of bannockburn. after that he reigned in effect as king of scotland, though he did not secure english recognition of scotland's independence until 1328. bruce's rise from a hunted fugitive to ruler of an independent kingdom is seen by some as incredible, but it does not look incredible to those who have noticed how often in history seemingly lost causes have eventually triumphed. in the autumn of 1878, the social democratic movement in germany was very nearly destroyed by the socialist law of october 19 of that year, which was enforced with extreme severity and had the effect of abolishing any ""societies with 'social-democratic, socialistic, or communist' tendencies."" ""as their foes were encouraged, many of the social democrats lost heart . . . . [t]he movement nearly disintegrated completely.

(luther's forerunner jan hus was burned at the stake for his ideas.) consequently, new ideas were a scarce commodity, and intense dissatisfactions could long fester unarticulated for lack of anyone to articulate them. a thinker who was bold enough to express dissent publicly and able to do so eloquently might trigger a release of pent-up resentments. when this occurred it was probably much easier to organize a rebellion in those days than it is now, because people were much less effectively conditioned to obedience, docility, and passivity than they are today. in fact, by modern standards the people of luther's time were lawless. nowadays, however, there is a surfeit of ideas, including dissident and even outrageous ones. artists and writers strive to outdo one another in thumbing their noses at conventional values. consequently new ideas, however outrageous, evoke a yawn from many people, from others only an expression of irritation, and serve the remainder of the population as mere entertainment. to their contemporaries, the ideas of men like hus and luther suggested the possible opening of a new era, but no ideas do that today because new ideas are so commonplace that no one takes them seriously any more. except, of course, technological ideas. at present, organization for practical action is more difficult not only because new ideas no longer evoke a strong response, but also because of people's docility, passivity, and ""learned helplessness."" professional political operatives do exploit people's discontents to organize support for their parties, candidates, or movements, but this only makes the task of organization more difficult for amateurs, who are poorly equipped to compete with skilled professionals for people's attention and commitment. thus, whatever may have been the case in the past, in the modern world the critical challenge for anyone wishing to transform society is not the propagation of ideas, but organization for practical action. rule (iv) states that in order to keep itself faithful to its objective, a movement should devise means of excluding all unsuitable persons who may seek to join it. it is difficult to examine this rule in the light of historical examples, because very little relevant information seems to be available in the histories of past movements.120 hardly any evidence known to this writer suggests that past movements had explicit policies designed to exclude unsuitable persons, but probably many movements have had informal or even unconscious means of excluding persons perceived as unsuitable. for example, such persons might simply have been given the cold shoulder at meetings. but one may doubt the effectiveness of such unsystematic ways of keeping a movement ""pure."" prior to their seizure of power in october 1917, the bolsheviks probably were highly selective in accepting new members, since lenin was ""always extremely sensitive to the question of the ingredients of the party."" this selectiveness may have played an important role in the success of the bolsheviks as a revolutionary party. (as we saw in discussing postulate 4 above, once the bolsheviks/communists were in power, it proved impossible to screen out the droves of opportunists who sought to join them.) in the years preceding the communist victory in china, mao repeatedly referred to the problem of weeding out the ""careerists,"" ""saboteurs,"" ""degenerates,"" ""undesirables,"" and ""traitors"" who ""sneaked"" into the party. but nowhere in the selected readings from his works does mao explain what he means by ""saboteurs,"" ""degenerates,"" etc., nor does he tell us how these individuals are to be identified and excluded. in 1841 there was an attempt to set up a utopian community at brook farm in massachusetts. though the community was linked with the distinguished intellectuals of the transcendental club it failed within a few years, perhaps in part because it was joined by too many of ""the conceited, the crotchety, the selfish, the headstrong, the pugnacious, the unappreciated, the played-out, the idle, the good-for-nothing generally; who, finding themselves utterly out of place and at a discount in the world as it is, rashly concluded that they are exactly fitted for the world as it ought to be."" it has been suggested that the brook farm experiment would have had a better chance of success if ""standards of recruitment"" had been applied. the fact that the 19th-century feminist movement lent its support to victoria woodhull, who was a spiritualist charlatan and an advocate of a crackpot variety of socialism, suggests that the movement may not have been highly selective in accepting participants. if that is true, then the movement may have been saved by its focus on the single goal of woman suffrage. as was mentioned in the discussion of postulate 3, if a movement's goal is clear, simple, and concrete, the goal perhaps will not be so easily blurred or perverted by unsuitable persons who join the movement. in relation to rule (iv) there is also the question of where to draw the boundary of the ""movement"" from which unsuitable persons are to be excluded. if a movement has an inner circle and an outer circle, and if the inner circle maintains firm control over the outer circle, then exclusion of unsuitable persons from the inner circle may be sufficient even if all comers are admitted to the outer circle. it's very probable that the irish patriot daniel o'connell had his movement for catholic emancipation firmly under his own personal control for the six years of its existence,1823-29. but whatever may have been the degree of o'connell's personal control over it, his superbly organized and highly disciplined movement must have been governed by some limited inner circle that presumably was kept ""pure"" through formal or informal selectiveness in recruitment. recruitment to the outer circle of the movement was indiscriminate-anyone could join by paying minimal dues-but the controlling inner circle evidently kept the movement faithful to its objective. referring to the period about 1908-1912, the historian writes of the extreme irish nationalist movement: sinn fein .. . [was] a rallying point for all radical, dissatisfied and potentially disappointed individual nationalists in ireland. the hybrid nature of its support with an overlap of poets, eccentrics, members of the irish republican brotherhood, politically-minded gaelic leaguers and frustrated parliamentarians had been the movement's chief characteristic. many lone wolves with a romantic or otherwise obsessional love of ireland that had been born of irish history, but frustrated in the present, gravitated towards sinn fein. as with every movement that attracts rebels there were those who [were impelled by] obscure psychological motives of their own. evidently, then, any irishman ""opposed to british rule in ireland"" could participate in sinn fein, and like many other radical movements it attracted a motley assortment of oddballs. but it is possible to identify with a reasonable degree of confidence the factors that rescued the movement from impotence. first, the movement was focused on the single, clear, simple, concrete objective of total political independence for lreland, and, as noted earlier, such an objective is not as easily perverted as a more diffuse one. moreover, beginning in 1917, michael collins with a limited inner circle of collaborators progressively took over effective control of the movement, and the inner circle, because it was relatively small, was probably easy to keep ""pure"" (i.e., faithful to the movement's objective) even without formal standards of recruitment. it's true that collins and his inner circle were by no means able to control in detail the actions of their guerrilla fighters,134 but involvement in a guerrilla war was itself a powerful factor in keeping the movement faithful to its objective. if a movement is locked in a desperate struggle, that fact will tend strongly to unite the movement behind its leaders and behind its principal objective. in summary, this writer has found very little evidence concerning any formal or informal, conscious or unconscious means that may have been used to exclude unsuitable persons from radical movements of the past. it is clear, however, that the kinds of people who join a movement necessarily have a profound effect on its character and can blur or change its goals. if some of the movements we've looked at have remained faithful to their goals without any premeditated effort to exclude unsuitable persons, then they've been lucky. a nascent movement that is not content to depend on luck needs to give close attention to the question of the kinds of people who are to comprise the movement. rule (v) states that once a revolutionary movement has become powerful",27.78

evolution through natural selection cannot continue long enough to create global self-prop systems possessing the subtle and sophisticated mechanisms that prevent destructive internal competition within complex biological organisms. meanwhile, fierce competition among global self-prop systems will have led to such drastic and rapid alterations in the earth's climate, the composition of its atmosphere, the chemistry of its oceans, and so forth, that the effect on the biosphere will be devastating. in part iv of the present chapter we will carry this line of inquiry further: we will argue that if the development of the technological world-system is allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion, then in all probability the earth will be left a dead planet-a planet on which nothing will remain alive except, maybe, some of the simplest organisms-certain bacteria, algae, etc.-that are capable of surviving under extreme conditions. the theory we've outlined here provides a plausible explanation for the so-called fermi paradox. it is believed that there should be numerous planets on which technologically advanced civilizations have evolved, and which are not so remote from us that we could not by this time have detected their radio transmissions. the fermi paradox consists in the fact that our astronomers have never yet been able to detect any radio signals that seem to have originated from an intelligent extraterrestrial source. according to ray kurzweil, one common explanation of the fermi paradox is ""that a civilization may obliterate itself once it reaches radio capability."" kurzweil continues: ""this explanation might be acceptable if we were talking about only a few such civilizations, but [if such civilizations have been numerous], it is not credible to believe that every one of them destroyed itself ""kurzweil would be right if the self-destruction of a civilization were merely a matter of chance. but there is nothing implausible about the foregoing explanation of the fermi paradox if there is a process common to all technologically advanced civilizations that consistently leads them to self-destruction. here we've been arguing that there is such a process. iii. our discussion of self-propagating systems merely describes in general and abstract terms what we see going on all around us in concrete form: organizations, movements, ideologies are locked in an unremitting struggle for power. those that fail to compete successfully are eliminated or subjugated. the struggle is almost exclusively for power in the short term; the competitors show scant concern even for their own long-term survival, let alone for the welfare of the human race or of the biosphere. that's why nuclear weapons have not been banned, emissions of carbon dioxide have not been reduced to a safe level, the earth's resources are being exploited at an utterly reckless rate, and no limitation has been placed on the development of powerful but dangerous technologies. the purpose of describing the process in general and abstract terms, as we've done here, is to show that what is happening to our world is not accidental; it is not the result of some chance conjunction of historical circumstances or of some flaw of character peculiar to human beings. given the nature of self-propagating systems in general, the destructive process that we see today is made inevitable by a combination of two factors: the colossal power of modern technology and the availability of rapid transportation and communication between any two parts of the world. recognition of this may help us to avoid wasting time on naive efforts to solve our current problems. for example, on efforts to teach people to conserve energy and resources. such efforts accomplish nothing whatever. it seems amazing that those who advocate energy conservation haven't noticed what happens: as soon as some energy is freed up by conservation, the technological world-system gobbles it up and demands more. no matter how much energy is provided, the system always expands rapidly until it is using all available energy, and then it demands still more. the same is true of other resources. the technological world-system infallibly expands until it reaches a limit imposed by an insufficiency of resources, and then it tries to push beyond that limit regardless of consequences. this is explained by the theory of self-propagating systems: those organizations (or other self-prop systems) that least allow respect for the environment to interfere with their pursuit of power here and now, tend to acquire more power than those that limit their pursuit of power from concern about what will happen to our environment fifty years from now, or even ten years. (proposition 2.) thus, through a process of natural selection, the world comes to be dominated by organizations that make maximum possible use of all available resources to augment their own power without regard to long-term consequences. environmental do-gooders may answer that if the public has been persuaded to take environmental concerns seriously it will be disadvantageous in terms of natural selection for an organization to abuse the environment, because citizens can offer resistance to environmentally reckless organizations. for example, people might refuse to buy products manufactured by companies that are environmentally destructive. however, human behavior and human attitudes can be manipulated. environmental damage can be shielded, up to a point, from public scrutiny; with the help of public-relations firms, a corporation can persuade people that it is environmentally responsible; advertising and marketing techniques can give people such an itch to possess a corporation's products that few individuals will refuse to buy them from concern for the environment; computer games, electronic social networking, and other mechanisms of escape keep people absorbed in hedonistic pursuits so that they don't have time for environmental worries. more importantly, people are made to see themselves as utterly dependent on the products and services provided by the corporations. because people have to earn money to buy the products and services on which they are dependent, they need jobs. economic growth is necessary for the creation of jobs, therefore people accept environmental damage when it is portrayed as a price that must be paid for economic growth. nationalism too is brought into play both by corporations and by governments. citizens are made to feel that outside forces are threatening: ""the chinese will get ahead of us if we don't increase our rate of economic growth. al qgeda will blow us up if we don't improve our technology and our weaponry fast enough."" these are some of the tools that organizations use to counter environmentalists' efforts to arouse public concern; similar tools can help to blunt other forms of resistance to the organizations' pursuit of power. the organizations that are most successful in blunting public resistance to their pursuit of power tend to increase their power more rapidly than organizations that are less successful in blunting public resistance. thus, through a process of natural selection, there evolve organizations that possess more and more sophisticated and effective means of blunting public resistance to their power-seeking activities, whatever the degree of environmental damage involved. because such organizations have great wealth at their disposal, environmentalists do not have the resources to compete with them in the propaganda war. this is the reason, or an important part of the reason, why attempts to teach people to be environmentally responsible have done so little to slow the destruction of our environment. and again-note well-the process we've described is not contingent on any accidental set of circumstances or on any defect in human character. given the availability of advanced technology, the process inevitably accompanies the action of natural selection upon self-propagating systems. iv. people who know something about the biological past of the earth and see what the technological system is doing to our planet speak of a ""sixth mass extinction,"" which they think is now in progress. apparently they envision something like the extinction event at the end of the cretaceous period, when the dinosaurs died out: they assume that many kinds of complex organisms will survive, and the species that become extinct will be replaced by complex organisms of a different kind, just as the dinosaurs were replaced by mammals. here we argue that this (relatively) comforting assumption is unjustified, because the extinction event that has now begun is of a fundamentally different kind than all of the previous mass extinctions that have occurred on this planet. so far as is known, each previous mass extinction has resulted from the arrival of some one major disruptive factor, or at most perhaps two or three such factors. thus, it is widely believed that the dinosaurs were wiped out by the impact of an asteroid that kicked up colossal clouds of dust. these obstructed the light of the sun, cooling the planet and interfering with photosynthesis. presumably, mammals were better able to survive under these conditions than the dinosaurs were. there are paleontologists who argue that some species of dinosaurs survived for as long as a million years after the impact of the asteroid, hence, that the asteroid alone was not enough to account for",27.78

the government, the media, the educational system, environmentalists, everyone inundates us with a mass of propaganda about recycling. need more technical personnel? a chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science. no one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects most of them hate. when skilled workers are put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo “retraining,” no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way. it is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity. and for good reason: if human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems, unemployment, shortages or worse. the concept of “mental health” in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress. efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within the system are no better than a joke. for example, one company, instead of having each of its employees assemble only one section of a catalogue, had each assemble a whole catalogue, and this was supposed to give them a sense of purpose and achievement. some companies have tried to give their employees more autonomy in their work, but for practical reasons this usually can be done only to a very limited extent, and in any case employees are never given autonomy as to ultimate goals -- their “autonomous” efforts can never be directed toward goals that they select personally, but only toward their employer’s goals, such as the survival and growth of the company. any company would soon go out of business if it permitted its employees to act otherwise. similarly, in any enterprise within a socialist system, workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of the enterprise, otherwise the enterprise will not serve its purpose as part of the system. once again, for purely technical reasons it is not possible for most individuals or small groups to have much autonomy in industrial society. even the small-business owner commonly has only limited autonomy. apart from the necessity of government regulation, he is restricted by the fact that he must fit into the economic system and conform to its requirements. for instance, when someone develops a new technology, the small- business person often has to use that technology whether he wants to or not, in order to remain competitive. a further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor of freedom is that modern technology is a unified system in which all parts are dependent on one another. you can’t get rid of the “bad” parts of technology and retain only the “good” parts. take modern medicine, for example. progress in medical science depends on progress in chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and other fields. advanced medical treatments require expensive, high-tech equipment that can be made available only by a technologically progressive, economically rich society. clearly you can’t have much progress in medicine without the whole technological system and everything that goes with it. even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest of the technological system, it would by itself bring certain evils. suppose for example that a cure for diabetes is discovered. people with a genetic tendency to diabetes will then be able to survive and reproduce as well as anyone else. natural selection against genes for diabetes will cease and such genes will spread throughout the population. (this may be occurring to some extent already, since diabetes, while not curable, can be controlled through use of insulin.) the same thing will happen with many other diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic degradation of the population. the only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic engineering of human beings, so that man in the future will no longer be a creation of nature, or of chance, or of god (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product. if you think that big government interferes in your life too much now, just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your children. such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous. the usual response to such concerns is to talk about “medical ethics.” but a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. a code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings. somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were “ethical”. and others were not, so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an “ethical” use of genetic engineering. the only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited any genetic engineering of human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. no code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today’s world). inevitably, genetic engineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial-technological",24.19

so is the drive for power. moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. for example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. but leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. helping black people is not their real goal. instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. in doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists' hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred. 22. if our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to invent problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss. 23. we emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. it is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism. 24. psychologists use the term ""socialization"" to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. a person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. it may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. nevertheless, the position can be defended. many leftists are not such rebels as they seem. 25. the moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. for example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. in order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. we use the term ""oversocialized"" to describe such people. 26. oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. one of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society's expectations. if this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of himself. moreover the thought and the behavior of the over-socialized person are more restricted by society's expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. the majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. they lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. the oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. the oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think ""unclean"" thoughts. and socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. in many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. we suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another. 27. we argue that a very important and infl uential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper middle class. notice that university intellectuals' ''constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment. 28. the leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. but usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. generally speaking, the goals of today's leftists are not in conflict with the accepted morality. on the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. more fundamen tally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. all these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes) for a long time. these values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these",21.13

(yes, we know that depression is often of purely genetic origin. we are referring here to those cases in which environment plays the predominant role.) 146. drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the methods of controlling human behavior that modern society is developing. let us look at some of the other methods. 147. to start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. hidden video cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places, computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals. information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion (i.e., law enforcement). then there are the methods of propaganda, for which the mass communications media provide effective vehicles. efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections, selling products, influencing public opinion. the entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. entertainment provides modern man with an essential means of escape. while absorbed in television, videos, etc., he can forget stress, anxiety, f rustration, dissatisfaction. many primitive peoples, when they don't have any work to do, are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all, because they are at peace with themselves and their world. but most modern people must be constantly occupied or entertained, otherwise they get ""bored,"" i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, irritable. 148. other techniques strike deeper that the foregoing. education is no longer a simple affair of paddling a kid's behind when he doesn't know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them. it is becoming a scientific technique for controlling the child's development. sylvan learning centers, for example, have had great success in motivating children to study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success in many conventional schools. ""parenting"" techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept the fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable. ""mental health"" programs, ""intervention"" techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are ostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually serve as methods for inducing individuals to think and behave as the system requires. (there is no contradiction here; an individual whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer fr«m stress, frustration, defeat. his path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. in that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.) child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in most if not all cultures. tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone. but many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly. is spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse? the question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in well with the existing system of society. in practice, the word ""abuse"" tends to be interpreted to include any method of child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system. thus, when they go beyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing ""child abuse"" are directed toward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system. 149. presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness of psychological techniques for controlling human behavior. but we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating. biological methods probably will have to be used. we have already mentioned the use of drugs in this connection. neurology may provide other avenues for modifying the human mind. genetic engineering of human beings is already beginning to occur in the form of ""gene therapy,"" and there is no reason to assume that such methods will not eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect mental functioning. 150. as we mentioned in paragraph 134, industrial society seems likely to be entering a period of severe stress, due in part to problems of human behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems. and a considerable proportion of the system's economic and environmental problems result from the way human beings behave. alienation, low self- esteem, depression, hostility, rebellion; children who won't study, youth gangs, illegal drug use, rape, child abuse, other crimes, unsafe sex, teen pregnancy, population growth, political corruption, race hatred, ethnic rivalry, bitter ideological conflict (e.g., pro-choice vs. pro-life), political extremism, terrorism, sabotage, anti-government groups, hate groups. all these threaten the very survival of the system. the system will therefore be forced to use every practical means of controlling human behavior. l5l.the social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result of mere chance. it can only be a result of the conditions of life that the system imposes on people. (we have argued that the most important of these conditions is disruption of the power process.) if the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient control over human behavior to assure its own survival, a new watershed in human history will have been passed. whereas formerly the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on the development of societies (as we explained in paragraphs 143, 144), industrial-technological society will be able to pass those limits by modifying human beings, whether by psychological methods or biological methods or both. in the future, social systems will not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. instead, human beings will be adjusted to suit the needs of the system. 152. generally speaking, technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a totalitarian intention or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom. each new step in the assertion of control over the human mind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society, such as curing alcoholism, reducing the crime rate or inducing young people to study science and engineering. in many cases, there will be a humanitarian justification. for example, when a psychiatrist prescribes an antidepressant for a depressed patient, he is clearly doing that individual a favor. it would be inhumane to withhold the drug from someone who needs it. when parents send their children to sylvan learning centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about their studies, they do so from concern for their children's welfare. it may be that some of these parents wish that one didn't have to have specialized training to get a job and that their kid didn't have to be brainwashed into becoming a computer nerd. but what can they do? they can't change society, and their child may be unemployable if he doesn't have certain skills. so they send him to sylvan.",20.55

(also, see paragraphs 227-230.) even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. all we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. we by no means claim to be telling the whole truth about leftist psychology. also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. we leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries. the two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential. by “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. we argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism. when someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. this tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. they are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. the terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped” or “chick” for an african, an asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. “broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” the negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.” leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. they want to replace the word “primitive” by “nonliterate.” they may seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to ours. (we do not mean to imply that primitive cultures are inferior to ours. we merely point out the hyper sensitivity of leftish anthropologists.) those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families. many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (american indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. the leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. they would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (we do not mean to suggest that women, indians, etc. are inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.) feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may not be as strong and as capable as men. leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. they hate america, they hate western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. the reasons that leftists give for hating the west, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. they say they hate the west because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he grudgingly admits that they exist; whereas he enthusiastically points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in western civilization. thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s real motive for hating america and the west. he hates america and the west because they are strong and successful. words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. the leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. he wants society to solve every one’s problems for them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. he is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. the leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser. art forms that appeal to modern leftish",21.74

"" he adds no qualifiers-no ""probably,"" no ""if things turn out as expected."" his whole book reveals a man intoxicated with a vision of the future in which, as an immortal machine, he will participate in the conquest of the universe. in fact, kurzweil and other techies are living in a fantasy world. the techies' belief-system can best be explained as a religious phenomenon, to which we may give the name ""technianity."" it's true that technianity at this point is not strictly speaking a religion, because it has not yet developed anything resembling a uniform body of doctrine; the techies' beliefs are widely varied. ln this respect technianity probably resembles the inceptive stages of many other religions. nevertheless, technianity already has the earmarks of an apocalyptic and millenarian cult: in most versions it anticipates a cataclysmic event, the singularity, which is the point at which technological progress is supposed to become so rapid as to resemble an explosion. this is analogous to the judgment day of christian mythology or the revolution of marxist mythology. the cataclysmic event is supposed to be followed by the arrival of techno-utopia (analogous to the kingdom of god or the worker's paradise). technianity has a favored minority-the elect-consisting of the techies (equivalent to the true believers of christianity or the proletariat of the marxists). the elect of technianity, like that of christianity, is destined to eternal life; though this element is missing from marxism. historically, millenarian cults have tended to emerge at ""times of great social change or crisis."" this suggests that the techies' beliefs reflect not a genuine confidence in technology, but rather their own anxieties about the future of the technological society-anxieties from which they try to escape by creating a quasi-religious myth. chapter three how to transform a society: errors to avoid in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved. -mao zedong in this chapter we will state some rules that deserve the attention of anyone who wants to bring about radical changes in a society. not all of the rules are precise enough to be easily applied and some may not be applicable in every situation, but if a radical movement fails to take the rules into account it risks throwing away its chances of success. in the first part of this chapter we will give a brief and simplified explanation of the rules. further on we will examine the meaning of the rules, illustrate them with examples, and discuss the limits of their applicability. in the last part of the chapter we will show how ignorance of the rules ensures the failure of present-day efforts to deal with the problems generated by modern technology, including the problem of environmental devastation. i. postulates and rules we begin by stating four postulates. we postpone a discussion of the extent to which the postulates are true. postulate 1. you can't change a society by pursuing goals that are vague or abstract. you have to have a clear and concrete goal. as an experienced activist put it: ""vague, over-generalized objectives are seldom met. the trick is to conceive of some specific development which will inevitably propel your community in the direction you want it to go."" postulate 2. preaching alone-the mere advocacy of ideas-cannot bring about important, long-lasting changes in the behavior of human beings, unless in a very small minority. postulate 3. any radical movement tends to attract many people who may be sincere, but whose goals are only loosely related to the goals of the movement. the result is that the movement's original goals may become blurred, if not completely perverted. postulate 4. every radical movement that acquires great power becomes corrupt, at the latest, when its original leaders (meaning those who joined the movement while it was still relatively weak) are all dead or politically inactive. in saying that a movement becomes corrupt, we mean that its members, and especially its leaders, primarily seek personal advantages (such as money, security, social status, powerful offices, or a career) rather than dedicating themselves sincerely to the ideals of the movement. from these postulates we can infer certain rules to which every radical movement should pay close attention. rule (i) in order to change a society in a specified way, a movement should select a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective the achievement of which will produce the desired change. it follows from postulate 1 that the movement's objectives must be clear and concrete. according to postulate 3 there will be a tendency for the movement's objectives to become blurred or perverted, and this tendency will be most easily resisted if the movement has only a single objective that is simple in addition to being clear and concrete. as seen in the epigraph, above, mao emphasized the importance of identifying the",26.79

(unless various other societies have passed through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences, in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that another society that passes through the same change will be likely to experience similar consequences.) 104. fourth principle. a new kind of society cannot be designed on paper, lhat is, you cannot plan out a new form of society in advance, then set it up and expect it to function as it was designed to do. 105. the third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human societies. a change in human behavior will affect the economy of a society and its physical environment; the economy will aff ect the environment and vice versa, and the changes in the economy and the environment will affect human behavior in complex, unpredictable ways; and so forth. the network of causes and effects is far too complex to be untangled and understood. 106. fifth principle. people do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their society. societies develop through processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control. 107. the fifth principle is a consequence of the other four. 108. to illustrate: by the first principle, generally speaking an attempt at social reform either acts in the direction in which the society is developing anyway (so that it merely accelerates a change that would have occurred in any case) or else it has only a transitory effect, so that the society soon slips back into its old groove. to make a lasting change in the direction of development of any important aspect of a society, reform is insufficient and revolution is required. (a revolution does not necessarily involve an armed uprising or the overthrow of a government.) by the second principle, a revolution never changes only one aspect of a society, it changes the whole society; and by the third principle changes occur that were never expected or desired by the revolutionaries. by the fourth principle, when revolutionaries or utopians set up a new kind of society, it never works out as planned. 109. the american revolution does not provide a counterexample. the american ""revolution""was not a revolution in our sense of the word, but a war of independence followed by a rather far-reaching political reform. the founding fathers did not change the direction of development of american society, nor did they aspire to do so. they only freed the development of american society from the retarding effect of british rule.lheir political reform did not change any basic trend, but only pushed american political culture along its natural direction of development. british society, of which american society was an offshoot, had been moving for a long time in the direction of representative democracy. and prior to the war of independence the americans were already practicing a significant degree of representative democracy in the colonial assemblies. the political system established by the constitution was modeled on the british system and on the colonial assemblies. with major alterations, to be sure — there is no doubt that the founding fathers took a very important step. but it was a step along the road that the english-speaking world was already traveling. the proof is that britain and all of its colonies that were populated predominantly by people of british descent ended up with systems of representative democracy essentially similar to that of the united states. if the founding fathers had lost their nerve and declined to sign the declaration of independence, our way of life today would not have been significantly different. maybe we would have had somewhat closer ties to britain, and would have had a parliament and prime minister instead of a congress and president. no big deal. thus the american revolution provides not a counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them. 110. still, one has to use common sense in applying the principles. they are expressed in imprecise language that allows latitude for interpretation, and exceptions to them can be found. so we present these principles not as inviolable laws but as rules of thumb, or guides to thinking, that may provide a partial antidote to naive ideas about the future of society. the principles should be borne constantly in mind, and whenever one reaches a conclusion that conflicts with them one should carefully reexamine one's thinking and retain the conclusion only if one has good, solid reasons for doing so. 111. the foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult it would be to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom. hiere has been a consistent tendency, going back at least to the industrial revolution, for technology to strengthen the system at a high cost in individual freedom and local autonomy. hence any change designed to protect freedom from technology would be contrary to a fundamental trend in the development of our society. consequently, such a change either would be a transitory one — soon swamped by the tide of history — or, if large enough to be permanent, would alter the nature of our whole society. hiis by the first and second principles. moreover, since society would be altered in a way that could not be predicted in advance (third principle) there would be great risk. changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system. so any attempts at reform would be too timid to be effective. even if changes large enough to make a lasting difference were initiated, they would be retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent. thus, permanent changes in favor of freedom could be brought about only by persons prepared to accept radical, dangerous and unpredictable alteration of the entire system. in other words by revolutionaries, not reformers. 112. people anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed benefi ts of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of society that would reconcile freedom with technology. apart from the fact that people who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the new form of society could be set up in the first place, it follows from the fourth principle that even if the new form of society could be once established, it either would collapse or would give results very different from those expected. 113. so even on very general grounds it seems highly improbable that any way of changing society could be found that would reconcile freedom with modern technology. in the next few sections we will give more specific reasons for concluding that freedom and technological progress are incompatible. 114. as explained in paragraphs 65-67, 70-73, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations, and his fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose decisions he cannot infl uence. this is not accidental or a result of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. it is necessary and inevitable in any technologically advanced society. the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function. at work, people have to do what they are told to do, when they are told to do it and in the way they are told to do it, otherwise production would be thrown into chaos. bureaucracies have to be run according to rigid rules. to allow any substantial personal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in the way individual bureaucrats",22.73

they may know very well, for example, how to organize a demonstration against some particular atrocity that is being committed against our environment. but when it comes to grand strategy they are at a loss. most perhaps recognize that any victory against an environmental atrocity or other technology-related evil can only be temporary, at best, as long as the technological system remains in existence. but they can think of nothing better to do than to continue attacking particular evils while vaguely hoping that their work will somehow help to solve the overall problem of technology. in reality their work is counterproductive, because it distracts attention from the technological system itself as the underlying source of the evils and leads people to focus instead on problems of limited significance that moreover cannot be permanently solved while the technological system continues to exist. the purpose of this book is to show people how to begin thinking in practical, grand-strategic terms about what must be done in order to get our society off the road to destruction that it is now on. on the basis of past experience i feel safe in saying that virtually all people-even people of exceptional intelligence-who merely read this book once or twice at an ordinary pace will miss many of its most important points. this book, therefore, is not a book to be read; it is a book to be studied with the same care that one would use in studying, for example, a textbook of engineering. there is of course a difference between this book and a textbook of engineering. an engineering textbook provides precise rules which, if followed mechanically, will consistently give the expected results. but no such precise and reliable rules are possible in the social sciences. the ideas in this book therefore need to be applied thoughtfully and creatively, not mechanically or rigidly. intelligent application of the ideas will be greatly facilitated by a broad knowledge of history and some understanding of how societies develop and change. ii. this book represents only a part, though the most important part, of a longer work that i hope to publish later. i've been anxious to get the most important part of the work into print as soon as possible, because the growth of technology and the destruction of our environment move at an ever-accelerating rate, and the time to begin organizing for action is-as soon as possible. moreover, i'm 72 years old, and i could be put out of action at any time by some medical misfortune, so i want to get the most important material into print while i can. the entire work-the part published here together with the parts that at present exist only in the form of imperfect drafts-goes far beyond my earlier works, industrial society and its future and technological slavery, and it represents the more-or-less final result of a lifetime of thought and reading-during the last thirty-five years, intensive thought and specifically purposeful reading. the factual basis of the work is drawn primarily from my reading over all those years, and especially from the reading i've done since 1998 while confined in a federal prison. as of 2011, however, there remained important loose ends that needed to be tied up, gaps that needed to be filled in, and i've been able to tie up those loose ends and fill in those gaps only with the generous help of several people outside the prison who have delved for the information i've requested and have answered almost all of the questions-sometimes very difficult questions-that i've asked them. my thanks are owing above all to susan gale. susan has played the key role in this project and has been indispensable. she has been my star researcher, producing more results and solving more problems, by far, than anyone else; she has ably coordinated the work of other researchers and has done most of the typing. after susan, the most important person in this project has been dr. julie ault. julie has read drafts of the various chapters and has called my attention to many weak points in the exposition. i've tried to correct these, though i haven't been able to correct all of them to my (or, i assume, her) satisfaction. in addition, julie has provided valuable advice on manuscript preparation. but most important of all has been the encouragement i've taken from the fact of having an intellectual heavyweight like julie ault on my side. several people other than susan have made important research contributions through steady work over a period of time: brandon manwell, deborah , g.g. gomez, valerie ve, and one other person whose name will not be mentioned here. patrick s and another person, who prefers not to be named, have provided critically important financial support and have been helpful in other ways as well. the foregoing are the people who have made major contributions to the project, but i owe thanks also to nine other people whose contributions have been of lesser magnitude: blake janssen, jon h, and philip r each dug up several pieces of information for me; lydia eccles, dr. david skrbina, isumatag (pseudonym), and ultimo reducto (pseudonym) have called my attention to information or sent me copies of articles that i've found useful; lydia has also performed other services, and an assistant of dr. skrbina's typed early drafts of chapter three and appendix three. on the legal front, i owe thanks to two attorneys for their pro-bono assistance: nancy j. flint, who took care of copyright registration, and edward t. ramey, whose intervention removed a bureaucratic obstacle to the preparation of this book. my thanks to all! iii. despite the generous help i've received, i've had to make use at many points of sources of information that are of doubtful reliability; for example, media reports (all too often irresponsible!) or encyclopedia articles, which, because of their necessary brevity, commonly give only sketchy accounts of the subjects they cover. none of the individuals named above are in any way responsible for the resulting defects of this book. it is only since 2011 that i've had people who have been willing and able to spend substantial amounts of time and effort in doing research for me, and all of them have had to carry on simultaneously with other necessary aspects of their lives, such as earning a living. if i had asked them to find solid authority for every piece of information for which i've relied on a questionable source, the completion of this book would have been delayed for a matter of years. i do not believe that my use of questionable sources of information will be found to weaken significantly the arguments or the conclusions that i offer in this book. even if some of the bits of information i've cited turn out to be false, inaccurate, or misleading, the basic structure of the book will remain sound. iv. note on referencing. in the notes that follow each chapter or appendix, i generally cite sources of information by giving the author's last name and a page number. the reader can find the author's full name, the title of the book or article cited, the date of publication, and other necessary information by looking up the author's name in the list of works cited that appears at the end of the book. when a source without named author is cited, the reader will in some cases be able to find additional information about the source by consulting the list of works",28.85

(nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) more reasonably, it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like china, vietnam and north korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world. that is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. true, there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at approximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators, lhat is a risk that has to be taken. and it is worth taking, since the difference between a ""democratic"" industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one.'""' it might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable, because dictator- controlled systems usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break down. look at cuba. 196. revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the world economy into a unified whole. free trade agreements like nafta and gatt are probably harmful to the environment in the short run, but in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence between nations. it will be easier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so unified that its breakdown in anyone major nation will lead to its breakdown in all industrialized nations. 197. some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. at best these people are expressing themselves unclearly, because they fail to distinguish between power for large organizations and power for individuals and small groups. it is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people need power. modern man as a collective entity — that is, the industrial system — has immense power over nature, and we (fc) regard this as evil. but modern individuals and small groups of individuals have far less power than primitive man ever did. generally speaking, the vast power of ""modern man"" over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. to the extent that the average modern individual can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (you need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) the individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. his personal power over nature is slight. 198. primitive individuals and small groups actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power within nature. when primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. he knew how to protect himself from heat, cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. but primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the collective power of primitive society was negligible compared to the collective power of industrial society. 199. instead »f arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the industrial system should be broken, and that this will greatly increase the power and freedom of individuals and small groups. 200. until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked, the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries' only goal. other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal. more importantly, if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology, they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal. if they give in to that temptation, they will fall right back into the technological trap, because modern technology is a unified, tightly organized system, so that, in order to retain some technology, one finds oneself obliged to retain most technology, hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology. 201. suppose for example that the revolutionaries took ""social justice"" as a goal. human nature being what it is, social justice would not come about spontaneously; it would have to be enforced. in order to enforce it the revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control. for that they would need rapid long-distance transportation and communication, and therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and communication systems. to feed and clothe poor people they would have to use agricultural and manufacturing technology. and so forth. so that the attempt to ensure social justice would force them to retain most parts of the technological system. not that we have anything against social justice, but it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system. 202. it would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system without using some modern technology. if nothing else they must use the communications media to spread their message. but they should use modern technology for only one purpose: to attack the technological system. 203. imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. suppose he starts saying to himself, ""wine isn't bad for you if used in moderation. why, they say small amounts of wine, are even good for you! it won't do me any harm if i take just one little drink...."" well, you know what is going to happen. never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine. 204. revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. there is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent inherited. no one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of a person's genetic constitution, but it appears that personality traits are partly inherited and that certain personality traits tend, within the context of our society, to make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude. objections to these findings have been raised,",21.13

what is difficult is the task of organizing for practical action. confronted with this task, people like glendinning feel intimidated. they are appalled at the catastrophic growth of the technological system and they want to do something about it, but they are too helpless and ineffectual to face up to the formidable challenge of building a movement. so to give themselves the illusion that they are ""doing something"" they preach about the way they think we should deal with technology or with the devastation of our environment. the result is that we have an abundance of dreamy utopian schemes for saving the world, but in practical terms nothing gets done. there are of course groups that do organize themselves in pursuit of fairly definite goals oflimited scope; for example, groups like the sierra club that try to preserve wilderness. and they do accomplish something-a little bit-but what they accomplish is insignificant in relation to the problem of technology in general. the insignificance of their accomplishments is guaranteed by the limited scope of their goals. since glendinning doesn't even mention the need to form an organized movement, the question of rule (iv) (that a movement should find means of excluding unsuitable persons) does not arise. but the worst is that glendinning is utterly naive; she doesn't even show any awareness that the problems indicated by rules (i) through (v) exist. her neo-luddite scheme therefore is no better than any of the other unreal utopian fantasies that have misled the unwary ever since plato dreamed up his ideal republic. skrbina's anthology also contains an essay by arne naess, the norwegian philosopher who coined the term ""deep ecology.""152 taken simply as criticisms of the technological system, many of naess's remarks are quite valid. but it appears that naess wants to bring about far-reaching, fundamental changes in the way the system functions in the real world, and to the extent his ideas are intended to lead us toward that practical objective, they are totally useless. naess's goals are-if such a thing is possible-even more diffuse than those proposed by glendinning. in fact, naess in this essay does not explicitly enumerate his goals at all. but he does write: a crucial objective of the coming years is . . . decentralisation and differentiation as a means to increased local autonomy and, ultimately, as a means to unfolding the rich potentialities of the human person. the ultimate goal, ""unfolding the rich potentialities of the human person,"" is just beautiful; one can hardly conceive of a more elegant platitude. but as a practical proposal it is meaningless. the intermediate goals of ""decentralisation"" and ""local autonomy"" are not meaningless, but they are still too vague to form the basis for an effective movement. naess also writes that it is ""a major concern to find a kind of equilibrium"" between ""the requirements of reduced interference with nature and satisfaction of human vital needs."" this does not even remotely approach the degree of specificity that a goal must have in order to be practical. naess does slightly better when he quotes eight pairs of related goals stated by johan galtung. two of the pairs are: clothes [:] build down international textile business [-] try to restore patterns of local handicraft: symbiosis with food production transportation/communication [:] less centralised, two-way patterns, collective means of transport [-] try to restore patterns of walking, talking, bicycling, more car-free areas, cable tv, local media most of galtung's goals are still too vague to serve as the basis for an effective movement, but some at least are definite enough so that individually they might serve as starting points from which one could try to develop more precise goals. however, eight pairs of goals are too many; and the achievement even of every one of galtung's goals would not be anywhere near enough to solve the overall problem of technology. thus, naess's scheme violates rule (i) as flagrantly as glendinning's does. naess is ignorant of rule (v): he thinks ""big, centralised, hierarchical"" social structures can be ""phased out gradually."" evidently he envisions a transformation of society that is to take at least a couple of generations; but in that case ""deep ecology"" will be corrupted long before the transformation is complete. once ""deep ecology"" has been corrupted, people in positions of power will pursue primarily their own advantage and will use ""deep ecology"" concepts only as propaganda if they use them at all. so the transformation envisioned by naess will never be completed. naess's scheme also violates rule (ii): even if society had somehow been transformed in the way naess desires, the transformation would not be irreversible. it seems clear that naess expects the retention of a good deal of advanced technology, and constant vigilance would be necessary to prevent that technology from being used in ways that were inconsistent with the kind of society that naess proposes. in practice, such vigilance would not be long maintained, because corruption (in our sense of the word) inevitably would set in. as for rule (iii), naess, like glendinning, seems to think he can save the world just by preaching, for he gives no indication of any awareness of the need to organize the ""deep ecology"" movement for practical action. we could review the work of other writers in this genre-ivan ilich, jerry mander, kirkpatrick sale, daniel qyinn, john zerzan, the whole useless crew-but there would be little point in doing so, because we would only be repeating the same criticisms that we've directed at glendinning and naess. this entire body of literature suffers, by and large, from the same faults as the work of these last two writers: authors express their well-grounded horror at what the technological system is doing, but the remedies they suggest are totally unrealistic. there are many reasons",24.21

""[t]he most precious of all revolutionary qualities, loyalty, has its inevitable counterpart in treachery.""161 members of any radical organization need to bear in mind at all times the likelihood that their group includes informers who will report their activities to law-enforcement or intelligence agencies, and they should remember that even individuals who are currently loyal may turn traitor at some later date. from 1967 until the early 1970s the fbi implemented a program known as cointelpro that involved, among other things, the systematic infiltration of informers into groups that the fbi found politically objectionable. cointelpro under that name has long since been discontinued but, needless to say, the fbi still uses similar methods today. in 2006, members of a group of eco-saboteurs were arrested with the help of an fbi informer who had infiltrated radical-environmentalist circles. at about the same time, in a related operation, the fbi arrested the group that had been responsible for the spectacular eco-arson at vail, colorado in 1998. one of the group's members had turned traitor and helped the fbi to collect evidence; some of the others subsequently testified against their comrades in order to get shorter sentences for themselves. in south africa the police used spies and informers with devastating effect against anti-apartheid activists, and some of the activists, when subjected to interrogation, gave information that helped the police to arrest their colleagues. in ireland, revolutionary groups were regularly infiltrated by government informers (though by 1919, under michael collins, the revolutionaries had turned the tables and developed a much better intelligence network than that of the government). fidel castro's guerrilleros felt it necessary to execute many traitors whom they discovered in their ranks. of the members of che guevara's guerrilla band in bolivia, some who were captured gave the authorities information about the members who were still free. during the period in which the social democrats of germany were outlawed (1878-1890), they established an ""intelligence system"" for the purpose of ""sifting and analyzing raw information to uncover informers and agents provocateur[s],""but this did not entirely protect them against infiltration by police agents. even one of the delegates to the social democrats' secret congress at wyden castle in switzerland (august 1880) was ""in the pay of the berlin police president."" in russia, the social revolutionaries' ""combat organization"" was headed for a time by a police agent. according to trotsky, as noted in section 10, above, three of the seven members of the bolsheviks' st. petersburg committee i n 1914 were police agents. a prominent bolshevik named malinovsky, who was the party's spokesman in the duma and played a critical role in the founding of pravda, later turned out to be a police agent. even after it should have been evident that malinovsky was a spy, lenin refused to believe it. the pattern is consistent and the lesson is clear: a radical group can never safely assume that its plans or its activities are unknown to the government. thus, a legal revolutionary organization is well advised to remain exactly that: strictly legal. any sort of dabbling in illegal activities is extremely dangerous. 28. it is important to study the history and the methods of earlier social and political movements and the techniques developed by successful leaders of such movements. it is a serious mistake to reject out of hand the techniques and the theories of revolutionaries or activists of the past merely because their goals were incompatible with anti-tech goals or because they were leftists or reformists. it's true that many of their methods must be rejected as unsuitable for use by an anti-tech organization today, and of their other methods many must be modified to adapt them to such use. neither history nor the principles laid down by past leaders will provide formulas or recipes for success that can be applied in cookbook fashion. but they provide ideas, of which some may lead to methods that are suitable for anti-tech use while others may call our attention to dangers or stumblingblocks that we need to avoid. mao emphasized not only the importance oflearning from the experience of the past as recorded in history, but also that theories derived from past experience were often incomplete and needed to be corrected through further experience. similarly, principles of action found to be valid in other contexts might not be applicable to the concrete situations arising in the development of a given revolution. consequently, from among such principles revolutionaries needed to sort out what was useful for their purposes from what was useless, discard the useless, and modify the useful to adapt",26.8

that exist on earth, together with the functional relations among them. the worldsystem probably should not be regarded as a self-prop system, but whether it is or not is irrelevant for present purposes. to summarize, then, the world-system is approaching a condition in which it will be dominated by a relatively small number of extremely powerful global self-prop systems. these global systems will compete for power-as they must do in order to have any chance of survival-and they will compete for power in the short term, with little or no regard for longterm consequences (proposition 2). under these conditions, intuition tells us that desperate competition among the global self-prop systems will tear the world-system apart. let's try to formulate this intuition more clearly. for some hundreds of millions of years the terrestrial environment has had some degree of stability, in the sense that conditions on earth, though variable, have remained within limits that have allowed the evolution of complex life-forms such as fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. in the immediate future, all self-prop systems on this planet, including self-propagating human groups and any purely machine-based systems derived from them, will have evolved while conditions have remained within these limits, or at most within somewhat wider ones. by proposition 3, the earth's selfprop systems will have become dependent for their survival on the fact that conditions have remained within these limits. large-scale self-prop human groups, as well as any purely machine-based self-prop systems, will be dependent also on conditions of more recent origin relating to the way the world-system is organized; for example, conditions relating to economic relationships. the rapidity with which these conditions change must remain within certain limits, else the self-prop systems will not survive. this doesn't mean that all of the world's self-prop systems will die if future conditions, or the rapidity with which they change, slightly exceed some of these limits, but it does mean that if conditions go far enough beyond the limits many self-prop systems are likely to die, and if conditions ever vary wildly enough outside the limits, then, with near certainty, all of the world's more complex self-prop systems will die without progeny. with several self-prop systems of global reach, armed with the colossal might of modern technology and competing for immediate power while exercising no restraint from concern for long-term consequences, it is extremely difficult to imagine that conditions on this planet will not be pushed far outside all earlier limits and batted around so erratically that for any of the earth's more complex self-prop systems, including complex biological organisms, the chances of survival will approach zero. notice that the crucial new factor here is the availability of rapid, worldwide transportation and communication, as a consequence of which there exist global self-prop systems. there is another way of seeing that this situation will lead to radical disruption of the world-system. students of industrial accidents know that a system is most likely to suffer a catastrophic breakdown when (i) the system is highly complex (meaning that small disruptions can produce unpredictable consequences), and (ii) tightly coupled (meaning that a breakdown in one part of the system spreads quickly to other parts). the world-system has been highly complex for a long time. what is new is that the world-system is now tightly coupled. this is a result of the availability of rapid, worldwide transportation and communication, which makes it possible for a breakdown in any one part of the world-system to spread to all other parts. as technology progresses and globalization grows more pervasive, the world-system becomes ever more complex and more tightly coupled, so that a catastrophic breakdown has to be expected sooner or later. it will perhaps be argued that destructive competition among global self-prop systems is not inevitable: a single global self-prop system might succeed in eliminating all of its competitors and thereafter dominate the world alone; or, because global self-prop systems would be relatively few in number, they could come to an agreement among themselves whereby they would refrain from all dangerous or destructive competition. however, while it is easy to talk about such an agreement, it is vastly more difficult actually to conclude one and enforce it. just look: the world's leading powers today have not been able to agree on the elimination of war or of nuclear weapons, or on the limitation of emissions of carbon dioxide. but let's be optimistic and assume that the world has come under the domination of a single, unified system, which may consist of a single global self-prop system victorious over all its rivals, or may be a composite of several global self-prop systems that have bound themselves together through an agreement that eliminates all destructive competition among them. the resulting ""world peace"" will be unstable for three separate reasons. first, the world-system will still be highly complex and tightly coupled. students of these matters recommend designing into industrial systems such safety features as ""decoupling,"" that is, the introduction of ""barriers"" that prevent malfunctions in one part of a system from spreading to other parts. such measures may be feasible, at least in theory, in any relatively limited subsystem of the world-system, such a s a chemical factory, a nuclear power-plant, or a banking system, though perrow13 is not optimistic that even these limited systems will ever be consistently redesigned throughout our society to minimize the risk of breakdowns within the individual systems. in regard to the world-system as a whole, we noted above that it grows ever more complex and more tightly coupled. to reverse this process and ""decouple"" the world-system would require the design, implementation, and enforcement of an elaborate plan that would regulate in detail the political and economic development of the entire world. for reasons explained at length in chapter one of this book, no such plan will ever be carried out successfully. second, prior to the arrival of ""world peace"" and for the sake of their own survival and propagation, the self-prop subsystems of a given global self-prop system (their supersystem) will have put aside, or at least moderated, their mutual conflicts in order to present a united front against any immediate external threats or challenges to the supersystem (which are also threats or challenges to themselves). in fact, the supersystem would never have been successful enough to become a global self-prop system if competition among its most powerful self-prop subsystems had not been moderated. but once a global self-prop system has eliminated its competitors, or has entered into an agreement that frees it from dangerous competition from other global self-prop systems, there will no longer be any immediate external threat to induce unity or a moderation of conflict among the self-prop subsystems of the global self-prop system. in view of proposition 2-which tells us that self-prop systems will compete with little regard for long-term consequences-unrestrained and therefore destructive competition will break out among the most powerful self-prop subsystems of the global self-prop system in question. benjamin franklin pointed out that ""the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc. are carried on and effected by parties."" each of the ""parties,"" according to franklin, is pursuing its own collective advantage, but ""as soon as a party has gained its general point""-and therefore, presumably, no longer faces immediate conflict with an external adversary-""each member becomes intent upon his particular interest, which, thwarting others, breaks that party into divisions and occasions . . . confusion."" history does generally confirm that when large human groups are not held together by any immediate external challenge, they tend strongly to break up into factions that compete against one another with little regard for long-term consequences.16 what we are arguing here is that this does not apply only to human groups, but expresses a tendency of self-propagating systems in general as they develop under the influence of natural selection. thus, the tendency is independent of any flaws of character peculiar to human beings, and the tendency will persist even if humans are ""cured"" of their purported defects or (as many technophiles envision) are replaced by intelligent machines. third, let's nevertheless assume that the most powerful self-prop subsystems of the global self-prop systems will not begin to compete destructively when the external challenges to their supersystems have been removed. there yet remains another reason why the ""world peace"" that we've postulated will be unstable. by proposition 1, within the ""peaceful"" world-system new self-prop systems will arise that, under the influence of natural selection, will evolve increasingly subtle and sophisticated ways of evading recognition-or, once they are recognized, evading suppression-by the dominant global self-prop systems. by the same process that led to the evolution of global self-prop systems in the first place, new self-prop

technology presents clear-cut material advantages, whereas freedom is an abstraction that means different things to different people. and its loss is easily obscured by propaganda and fancy talk. and note this important difference: it is conceivable that our environmental problems (for example) may some day be settled through a rational, comprehensive plan, but if this happens it will be only because it is in the long-term interest of the system to solve these problems. but it is not in the interest of the system to preserve freedom or small-group autonomy. on the contrary, it is in the interest of the system to bring human behavior under control to the greatest possible extent. thus, while practical considerations may eventually force the system to take a rational, prudent approach to environmental problems, equally practical considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior ever more closely (preferably by indirect means that will disguise the encroachment on freedom). this isn’t just our opinion. eminent social scientists (e.g. james q. wilson) have stressed the importance of “socializing” people more effectively. we hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in such a way as to reconcile freedom with technology. the only way out is to dispense with the industrial-technological system altogether. this implies revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature of society. 141. people tend to assume that because a revolution involves a much greater change than reform does, it is more difficult to bring about than reform is. actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than reform. the reason is that a revolutionary movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire. a reform movement merely offers to solve a particular social problem. a revolutionary movement offers to solve all problems at one stroke and create a whole new world; it provides the kind of ideal for which people will take great risks and make great sacrifices. for this reasons it would be much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to put effective, permanent restraints on the development or application of any one segment of technology, such as genetic engineering, for example. not many people will devote themselves with single-minded passion to imposing and maintaining restraints on genetic engineering, but under suitable conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves passionately to a revolution against the industrialtechnological system. as we noted in paragraph 132, reformers seeking to limit certain aspects of technology would be working to avoid a negative outcome. but revolutionaries work to gain a powerful reward -- fulfillment of their revolutionary vision and therefore work harder and more persistently than reformers do. reform is always restrained by the fear of painful consequences if changes go too far. but once a revolutionary fever has taken hold of a society, people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships for the sake of their revolution. this was clearly shown in the french and russian revolutions. it may be that in such cases only a minority of the population is really committed to the revolution, but this minority is sufficiently large and active so that it becomes the dominant force in society. we will have more to say about revolution in paragraphs 180-205. since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to put pressures on human beings of the sake of the functioning of the social organism. the kinds of pressures vary greatly from one society to another. some of the pressures are physical (poor diet, excessive labor, environmental pollution), some are psychological (noise, crowding, forcing human behavior into the mold that society requires). in the past, human nature has been approximately constant, or at any rate has varied only within certain bounds. consequently, societies have been able to push people only up to certain limits. when the limit of human endurance has been passed, things start going wrong: rebellion, or crime, or corruption, or evasion of work, or depression and other mental problems, or an elevated death rate, or a declining birth rate or something else, so that either the society breaks down, or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is (quickly or gradually, through conquest, attrition or evolution) replaced by some more efficient form of society. thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies. people could be pushed only so far and no farther. but today this may be changing, because modern technology is developing ways of modifying human beings. imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. science fiction? it is already happening to some extent in our own society. it is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades. we believe that this is due to disruption of the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76. but even if we are wrong, the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of some conditions that exist in today’s society. instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. in effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual’s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate",22.06

food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one’s environment. freedom means having power; not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one’s own life. one does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised. it is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72). it is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed rights. but these are not as important as they seem. the degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government. most of the indian nations of new england were monarchies, and many of the cities of the italian renaissance were controlled by dictators. but in reading about these societies one gets the impression that they allowed far more personal freedom than our society does. in part this was because they lacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler’s will: there were no modern, well-organized police forces, no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens. hence it was relatively easy to evade control. as for our constitutional rights, consider for example that of freedom of the press. we certainly don’t mean to knock that right; it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. but freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. the mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. to make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. take us (fc) for example. if we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. if they had been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it’s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. even if these writings had had many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them. in order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression, we’ve had to kill people. constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what might be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. according to the bourgeois conception, a “free” man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual. thus the bourgeois’s “free” man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and progress; he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders; he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. this was clearly the attitude of simon bolivar. to him, people deserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois). other bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a mere means to collective ends. chester c. tan, “chinese political thought in the twentieth century,” page 202, explains the philosophy of the kuomintang leader hu han-min: “an individual is granted rights because he is a member of society and his community life requires such rights. by community hu meant the whole society of the nation.” and on page 259 tan states that according to carsum chang (chang chun-mai, head of the state socialist party in china) freedom had to be used in the interest of the state and of the people as a whole. but what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone else prescribes? fc’s conception of freedom is not that of bolivar, hu, chang or other bourgeois theorists. the trouble with such theorists is that they have made the development and application of social theories their surrogate activity. consequently the theories are designed to serve the needs of the theorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the theories are imposed. one more point to be made in this section: it should not be assumed that a person has enough freedom just because he says he has enough. freedom is restricted in part by psychological controls of which people are unconscious, and moreover many people’s ideas of what constitutes freedom are governed more by social convention than by their real needs. for example, it’s likely that many leftists of the oversocialized type would say that most people, including themselves, are socialized too little rather than too much, yet the oversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of socialization. think of history as being the sum of two components: an erratic component that consists of unpredictable events that follow no discernible pattern, and a regular component that consists of long-term historical trends. here we are concerned with the long-term trends. first principle. if a small change is made that affects a long-term historical trend, then the effect of that change will almost always be transitory -- the trend will soon revert to its original state. (example: a reform movement designed to clean up political corruption in a society rarely has more than a short-term effect; sooner or later the reformers relax and corruption creeps back in. the level of political corruption in a given society tends to remain constant, or to change only slowly with the evolution of the society. normally, a political cleanup will be permanent only if accompanied by widespread social changes; a small change in the society won’t be enough.) if a small change in a long-term historical trend appears to be permanent, it is only because the change acts in the direction in which the trend is already moving, so that the trend is not altered by only pushed a step ahead. the first principle is almost a tautology. if a trend were not stable with respect to small changes, it would wander at random rather than following a definite direction; in other words it would not be a long-term trend",24.59

""lloyd george's reaction to hitler was typical: 'if only we had a man of his supreme quality in england today,' he said."" returning, then, to our hypothetical dictator, or philosopher-king as we've decided to call him, we'll assume, however implausibly, that he will somehow be able to overcome the problems of complexity, of the conflicts of many individual wills, of resistance by subordinates, and of the competitive, power-seeking groups or systems that will evolve within any complex, large-scale society. even under this unreal assumption we will still run into fundamental difficulties. the first problem is: who is going to choose the philosopher-king and how will they put him into power? given the vast disparities of goals and values (""conflicts among individual wills"") in any large-scale society, it is hardly likely that the rule of any one philosopher-king could be consistent with the goals and values of a majority of the population, or even with the goals and values of a majority of any elite stratum (the intellectuals, say, or scientists, or rich people) -except to the extent that the philosopher-king, once in power, might use propaganda or other techniques of human engineering to bring the values of the majority into line with his own. if the realities of practical politics are taken into account, it seems that anyone who might actually become a philosopher-king either would have to be a compromise candidate, a bland fellow whose chief concern would be to avoid offending anyone, or else would have to be the ruthless leader of an aggressive faction that drives its way to power. in the latter case he might be an unscrupulous person intent only on attaining power for himself (a hitler), or he might be a sincere fanatic convinced of the righteousness of his cause (a lenin), but either way he would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. thus, the citizen who might find the idea of a philosopher-king attractive should bear in mind that he himself would not select the philosopher-king, and that any philosopher-king who might come into power would probably not be the kind that he imagines or hopes for. a further problem is that of selecting a successor when the philosopher-king dies. each philosopher-king will have to be able to preselect reliably a successor whose goals and values are virtually identical to his own; for, otherwise, the first philosopher-king will steer the society in one direction, the second philosopher-king will steer the society in a somewhat different direction, the third philosopher-king will steer it in yet another direction, and so forth. the result will be that the development of the society in the long term will wander at random, rather than being steered in any consistent direction or in accord with any consistent policy as to what constitute desirable or undesirable outcomes. historically, in absolute monarchies of any kind-the roman empire makes a convenient example-it has proven impossible even to ensure the succession of rulers who are reasonably competent and conscientious. capable, conscientious rulers have alternated with those who have been irresponsible, corrupt, vicious or incompetent. as for a long, unbroken succession of rulers, each of whom not only is competent and conscientious but also has goals and values closely approximating those of his predecessor-you can forget it. all of these arguments, by the way, apply not only to philosopher-kings but also to philosopher-oligarchs-ruling groups small enough so that engels's ""conflicts among many individual wills"" do not come into play. c h a p t e r one : pa r t v i all the same, let's assume that it would somehow be possible to ensure the succession of a long line of philosopher-kings all of whom would govern in accord with a single, permanently stable system of values. in that event ... but hold on ... let's pause and take stock of the assumptions we've been making. we're assuming, among other things, that the problems of complexity, chaos, and the resistance of subordinates, also the purely technical factors that limit the options open to leaders, as well as the competitive, power-seeking groups that evolve within a society under the influence of natural selection, can all be overcome to such an extent that an all-powerful leader will be able to govern the society rationally; we're assuming that the ""conflicts among many individual wills"" within the society can be resolved well enough so that it will be possible to make a rational choice of leader; we're assuming that means will be found to put the chosen leader into a position of absolute power and to guarantee forever the succession of competent and conscientious leaders who will govern in accord with some stable and permanent system of values. and if the hypothetical possibility of steering a society rationally is to afford any comfort to the reader, he will have to assume that the system of values according to which the society is steered will be one that is at least marginally acceptable to himself-which is a sufficiently daring assumption. it's now clear that we have wandered into the realm of fantasy. it is impossible to prove with mathematical certainty that the development of a society can never be guided rationally over any significant interval of time, but the series of assumptions that we've had to make in order to entertain the possibility of rational guidance is so wildly improbable that for practical purposes we can safely assume that the development of societies will forever remain beyond rational human control. vi. it's likely that the chief criticism to be leveled at this chapter will be that the writer has expended a great deal of ink and paper to prove what ""everyone"" already knows. unfortunately, however, not everyone does know that the development of societies can never be subject to rational human control; and even many who would agree with that proposition as an abstract principle fail to apply the principle in concrete cases. again and again we find seemingly intelligent people proposing elaborate schemes for solving society's problems, completely oblivious to the fact that such schemes never, never, never are carried out successfully. in a particularly fuddled excursion into fantasy written several decades ago, the noted technology critic ivan illich asserted that ""society must be reconstructed to enlarge the contribution of autonomous individuals and primary groups to the total effectiveness of a new system of production designed to satisfy the human needs which it also determines,"" and that a ""convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others"" -as if a society could be consciously and rationally ""reconstructed"" or ""designed."" other egregious examples of this sort of folly were provided by arne naess and chellis glendinning in 1989 and 1990, respectively; these are discussed in part iv of chapter three of the present work. right down to the present (2013), people who should know better have continued to ignore the fact that the development of societies can never be rationally controlled. thus, we often find technophiles making such absurd statements as: ""humanity is in charge of its own fate""; ""[we will] take charge of our own evolution""; or, ""people [will] seize control of the evolutionary process."" the technophiles want to ""guide research so that technology improve[s] society""; they have created a ""singularity university"" and a ""singularity institute"" that are supposed to ""shape the advances and help society cope with the ramifications"" of technological progress, and ""make sure ... that artificial intelligence ... is friendly"" to humans. of course, the technophiles won't be able to ""shape the advances"" of technology or make sure that they ""improve society"" and are friendly to humans. technological advances will be ""shaped"" in the long run by unpredictable and uncontrollable power-struggles among rival groups that will develop and apply technology for the sole purpose of gaining advantages over their competitors. see chapter two of this book. it's not likely that the majority of technophiles fully believe in this drivel about ""shaping the advances"" of technology to ""improve society."" in practice, singularity university serves mainly to promote the interests of technology-oriented businessmen, while the fantasies about ""improving society"" function as propaganda that helps to forestall public resistance to radical technological innovation. but such propaganda is effective only because many laymen are naive enough to take the fantasies seriously.",36.59

""the weak one has little choice but to give in. some time later the powerful neighbor demands another piece of land, again there is a compromise, and so forth. by forcing a long series of compromises on the weaker man, the powerful one eventually gets all of his land. so it goes in the conflict between technology and freedom. 126. let us explain why technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom. 127. a technological advance that appears not to threaten f reedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. for example, consider motorized transport. a walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support systems. when motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man's freedom. they took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn't want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. but the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man's freedom of locomotion. when automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. in a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one's own pace; one's movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. one is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional. since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they have to depend on the automobile for transportation. or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. even the walker's freedom is now greatly restricted. in the city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. in the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (note this important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: when a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily remain optional. in many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves forced to use it.) 128. while technological progress as a whole continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new technical advance considered by itself appears to be desirable. electricity, indoor plumbing, rapid long- distance communications... how could one argue against any of these things, or against any other of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern society? it would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone, for example. it offered many advantages and no disadvantages. yet, as we explained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together have created a world in which the average man's fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in those of politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence. the same process will continue in the future. take genetic engineering, for example. few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease. it does no apparent harm and prevents much suff ering. yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free creation of chance (or of god, or whatever, depending on your religious beliefs). 129. another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that, within the context of a given society, technological progress marches in only one direction; it can never be reversed. once a technical innovation has been introduced, people usually become dependent on it, so that they can never again do without it, unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation. not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes dependent on it. (imagine what would happen to the system today if computers, for example, were eliminated.) thus the system can move in only one direction, toward greater technologization. technology repeatedly forces freedom to take a step back but technology can never take a step back — short of the overthrow of the whole technological system. 130. technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many different points at the same time (crowding, rules and regulations, increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations, propaganda and other psychological techniques, genetic engineering, invasion of privacy through surveillance devices and computers, etc.). to hold back any one of the threats to freedom would require a long and difficult social struggle. those who want to protect f reedom arc overwhelmed by the sheer number of new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop, hence they become apathetic and no longer resist. to fight each of the threats separately would be futile. success can be hoped for only by fighting the technological system as a whole; but that is revolution, not reform. 131. technicians (we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who perform a specialized task that requires training) tend to be so involved in their work (their surrogate activity) that when a conflict arises between their technical work and freedom, they almost always decide in favor of their technical work. this is obvious in the case of scientists, but it also appears elsewhere: educators, humanitarian groups, conservation organizations do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological techniques to help them achieve their laudable ends. corporations and government agencies, when they find it useful, do not hesitate to collect information about individuals without regard to their privacy. law enforcement agencies are frequently inconvenienced by the constitutional rights of suspects and often of completely inn»cent persons, and they do whatever they can do legally (or sometimes illegally) to restrict or circumvent those rights. most of these educators, government officials and law officers believe in freedom, privacy and constitutional rights, but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is more important. 132. it is well known that people generally work better and more persistently when striving for a reward",23.44

(yes, we know that depression is often of purely genetic origin. we are referring here to those cases in which environment plays the predominant role.) drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the new methods of controlling human behavior that modern society is developing. let us look at some of the other methods. to start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. hidden video cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places, computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals. information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion (i.e., law enforcement). then there are the methods of propaganda, for which the mass communication media provide effective vehicles. efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections, selling products, influencing public opinion. the entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. entertainment provides modern man with an essential means of escape. while absorbed in television, videos, etc., he can forget stress, anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction. many primitive peoples, when they don’t have work to do, are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all, because they are at peace with themselves and their world. but most modern people must be constantly occupied or entertained, otherwise they get “bored,” i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, irritable. other techniques strike deeper than the foregoing. education is no longer a simple affair of paddling a kid’s behind when he doesn’t know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them. it is becoming a scientific technique for controlling the child’s development. sylvan learning centers, for example, have had great success in motivating children to study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success in many conventional schools. “parenting” techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable. “mental health” programs, “intervention” techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are ostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually serve as methods for inducing individuals to think and behave as the system requires. (there is no contradiction here; an individual whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer from stress, frustration, defeat. his path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. in that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.) child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in most if not all cultures. tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone. but many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly. is spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse? the question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in well with the existing system of society. in practice, the word “abuse” tends to be interpreted to include any method of child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system. thus, when they go beyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing “child abuse” are directed toward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system. presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness of psychological techniques for controlling human behavior. but we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating. biological methods probably will have to be used. we have already mentioned the use of drugs in this connection. neurology may provide other avenues for modifying the human mind. genetic engineering of human beings is already beginning to occur in the form of “gene therapy,” and there is no reason to assume that such methods will not eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect mental functioning. as we mentioned in paragraph 134, industrial society seems likely to be entering a period of severe stress, due in part to problems of human behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems. and a considerable proportion of the system’s economic and environmental problems result from the way human beings behave. alienation, low self-esteem, depression, hostility, rebellion; children who won’t study, youth gangs, illegal drug use, rape, child abuse, other crimes, unsafe sex, teen pregnancy, population growth, political corruption, race hatred, ethnic rivalry, bitter ideological conflict (e.g., prochoice vs. pro-life), political extremism, terrorism, sabotage, anti-government groups, hate groups. all these threaten the very survival of the system. the system will therefore be forced to use every practical means of controlling human behavior. the social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result of mere chance. it can only be a result of the conditions of life that the system imposes on people. (we have argued that the most important of these conditions is disruption of the power process.) if the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient control over human behavior to assure its own survival, a new watershed in human history will have been passed. whereas formerly the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on the development of societies (as we explained in paragraphs 143, 144), industrial-technological society will be able to pass those limits by modifying human beings, whether by psychological methods or biological methods or both. in the future, social systems will not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. instead, human being will be adjusted to suit the needs of the system. generally speaking, technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a totalitarian intention or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom. each new step in the assertion of control over the human mind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society, such as curing alcoholism, reducing the crime rate or inducing young people to study science and engineering. in many cases there will be a humanitarian justification. for example, when a psychiatrist prescribes an anti-depressant for a depressed patient, he is clearly doing that individual a favor. it would be inhumane to withhold the drug from someone who needs it. when parents send their children to sylvan learning centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about their studies, they do so from concern for their children’s welfare. it may be that some of these parents wish that one didn’t have to have specialized training to get a job and that their kid didn’t have to be brainwashed into becoming a computer nerd. but what can they do? they can’t change society, and their child may be unemployable if he doesn’t have certain skills. so they send him to sylvan. thus control over human behavior will be introduced not by a calculated decision of the authorities but through a process of social evolution (rapid evolution, however). the process will be impossible to resist, because each advance, considered by itself, will appear to be beneficial, or at least the evil involved in making the advance will appear to be beneficial, or at least the evil involved in making the advance will seem to be less than that which would result from not making it (see paragraph 127). propaganda for example is used for many good purposes, such as discouraging child abuse or race hatred. sex education is obviously useful, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent that it is successful) is to take the shaping of sexual attitudes away from the family and put it into the hands of the state as represented by the public school system. suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the likelihood that a child will grow up to be a criminal, and suppose some sort of gene therapy can remove this trait. of course most parents whose children possess the trait will have them undergo the therapy. it would be inhumane to do otherwise, since the child would probably have a miserable life if he grew up to be a criminal. but many or most primitive societies have a low crime rate in comparison with that of our society, even though they have neither high-tech methods of child-rearing nor harsh systems of punishment. since there is no reason to suppose that more modern men than primitive men have innate predatory tendencies, the high crime rate of our society must be due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people, to which many cannot or will not adjust. thus a treatment designed to remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of re-engineering people so that",21.74

time that we can call time zero. those selfprop systems that are most likely to survive (or have surviving progeny) at five years from time zero are those that are best suited to survive and propagate themselves (in competition with other self-prop systems) during the five-year period following time zero. these will not necessarily be the same as those self-prop systems that, in the absence of competition during the five-year period, would be best suited to survive and propagate themselves during the thirty years following time zero. similarly, those systems best suited to survive competition during the first thirty years following time zero are not necessarily those that, in the absence of competition during the thirty-year period, would be best suited to survive and propagate themselves for two hundred years. and so forth. for example, suppose a forested region is occupied by a number of small, rival kingdoms. those kingdoms that clear the most land for agricultural use can plant more crops and therefore can support a larger population than other kingdoms. this gives them a military advantage over their rivals. if any kingdom restrains itself from excessive forest-clearance out of concern for the long-term consequences, then that kingdom places itself at a military disadvantage and is eliminated by the more powerful kingdoms. thus the region comes to be dominated by kingdoms that cut down their forests recklessly. the resulting deforestation leads eventually to ecological disaster and therefore to the collapse of all the kingdoms. here a trait that is advantageous or even indispensable for a kingdom's short-term survival-recklessness in cutting trees-leads in the long term to the demise of the same kingdom. this example illustrates the fact that, where a self-prop system exercises foresight, in the sense that concern for its own long-term survival and propagation leads it to place limitations on its efforts for short-term survival and propagation, the system puts itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to those self-prop systems that pursue short-term survival and propagation without restraint. this leads us to proposition 2. in the short term, natural selection favors selfpropagating systems that pursue their own short-term advantage with little or no regard for long-term consequences. a corollary to proposition 2 is proposition 3. self-propagating subsystems of a given supersystem tend to become dependent on the supersystem and on the specific conditions that prevail within the supersystem. this means that between the supersystem and its self-prop subsystems, there tends to develop a relationship of such a nature that, in the event of the destruction of the supersystem or of any drastic acceleration of changes in the conditions prevailing within the supersystem, the subsystems can neither survive nor propagate themselves. a self-prop system with sufficient foresight would make provision for its own or its descendants' survival in the event of the collapse or destabilization of the supersystem. but as long as the supersystem exists and remains more or less stable, natural selection favors those subsystems that take fullest advantage of the opportunities available within the supersystem, and disfavors those subsystems that ""waste"" some of their resources in preparing themselves to survive the eventual destabilization of the supersystem. under these conditions, self-prop systems will tend very strongly to become incapable of surviving the destabilization of any supersystem to which they belong. like the other propositions put forward in this chapter, proposition 3 has to be applied with a dose of common sense. if the supersystem in question is weak and loosely organized, or if it has no more than a modest effect on the conditions in which its subsystems exist, the subsystems may not become strongly dependent on the supersystem. among huntergatherers in some (not all) environments, a nuclear family would be able to survive and propagate itself independently of the band to which it belongs. because tribes of hunter-gatherers are loosely organized it seems certain that in most cases a hunting-and-gathering band would be able to survive independently of the tribe to which it belongs. many labor unions might be able to survive the demise of a confederation of labor unions such as the afl-cio, because such an event might not fundamentally affect the conditions under which labor unions have to function. but labor unions could not survive the demise of modern industrial society, or even the demise merely of the legal and constitutional framework that makes it possible for labor unions as we know them to operate. nor would many present-day business enterprises survive without modern industrial society. domestic sheep, if deprived of human protection, would soon be killed off by predators. and so forth. clearly a system cannot be effectively organized for its own survival and propagation unless the different parts of the system can promptly communicate with one another and lend aid to one another. in order to operate effectively throughout a given geographical region, a self-prop system must be able to receive prompt information from, and take prompt action within, every part of the region. consequently, proposition 4. problems of transportation and communication impose a limit on the size of the geographical region over which a self-prop system can extend its operations. human experience suggests: proposition 5. the most important and the only consistent limit on the size of the geographical regions over which self-propagating human groups extend their operations is the limit imposed by the available means of transportation and communication. in other words, while not all self-propagating human groups tend to extend their operations over a region of maximum size, natural selection tends to produce some self-propagating human groups that operate over regions approaching the maximum size allowed by the available means of transportation and communication. propositions 4 and 5 can be seen operating in human history. primitive bands or tribes usually have territories that they ""own,"" but these are relatively small because human feet are the only means of transportation available to these societies. however, primitives who have numerous horses and live in open country over which horses can travel freely, like the plains indians of north america, can hold much larger territories. pre-industrial civilizations built empires that extended over vast distances, but these empires actively created, if they did not already have, relatively rapid means of transportation and communication. such empires grew to a certain geographical size, after which they stopped growing and, in many cases, became unstable; that is, they tended to break up into smaller political units. though the hypothesis would be difficult to prove conclusively, it is at least highly plausible that these empires stopped growing and became unstable because they were at the limit of what was possible with the existing means of transportation and communication. today there is quick transportation and almost instant communication between any two parts of the world. hence, proposition 6. in modern times, natural selection tends to produce some self-propagating human groups whose operations span the entire globe. moreover, even if human beings are some day replaced by machines or other entities, natural selection will still tend to produce some selfpropagating systems whose operations span the entire globe. current experience strongly confirms this proposition: we see global ""superpowers,"" global corporations, global political movements, global religions, global criminal networks. proposition 6, we argue, is not dependent on any particular traits of human beings but only on the general properties of self-prop systems, so there is no reason to doubt that the proposition will remain true if and when humans are replaced by other entities: as long as rapid, worldwide transportation and communication remain available, natural selection will tend to produce or maintain self-prop systems whose operations span the entire globe. let's refer to such systems as global self-prop systems. instant worldwide communications are still a relatively new phenomenon and their full consequences have yet to be developed; in the future we can expect global self-prop systems to play an even more important role than they do today. proposition 7. where (as today) problems of transportation and communication do not constitute effective limitations on the size of the geographical regions over which self-propagating systems operate, natural selection tends to create a world in which power is mostly concentrated in the possession of a relatively small number of global self-propagating systems. this proposition too is suggested by human experience. but it's easy to see why the proposition should be true independently of anything specifically human: among global self-prop systems, natural selection will favor those that have the greatest power; global or other large-scale self-prop systems that are weaker will tend to be eliminated or subjugated. smallscale self-prop systems that are too numerous or too subtle to be noticed individually by the dominant global self-prop systems may retain more or less autonomy, but each of them will have influence only within some very limited sphere. it may be answered that a coalition of small-scale self-prop systems could challenge the global self-prop systems, but if small-scale self-prop systems organize themselves into a coalition having worldwide influence, then the coalition will itself be a global self-prop system. we can speak of the ""world-system,"" meaning all",28.85

(unless various other societies have passed through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences, in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that another society that passes through the same change will be like to experience similar consequences.) fourth principle. a new kind of society cannot be designed on paper. that is, you cannot plan out a new form of society in advance, then set it up and expect it to function as it was designed to do. the third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human societies. a change in human behavior will affect the economy of a society and its physical environment; the economy will affect the environment and vice versa, and the changes in the economy and the environment will affect human behavior in complex, unpredictable ways; and so forth. the network of causes and effects is far too complex to be untangled and understood. fifth principle. people do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their society. societies develop through processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control. the fifth principle is a consequence of the other four. to illustrate: by the first principle, generally speaking an attempt at social reform either acts in the direction in which the society is developing anyway (so that it merely accelerates a change that would have occurred in any case) or else it has only a transitory effect, so that the society soon slips back into its old groove. to make a lasting change in the direction of development of any important aspect of a society, reform is insufficient and revolution is required. (a revolution does not necessarily involve an armed uprising or the overthrow of a government.) by the second principle, a revolution never changes only one aspect of a society, it changes the whole society; and by the third principle changes occur that were never expected or desired by the revolutionaries. by the fourth principle, when revolutionaries or utopians set up a new kind of society, it never works out as planned. the american revolution does not provide a counterexample. the american “revolution” was not a revolution in our sense of the word, but a war of independence followed by a rather far-reaching political reform. the founding fathers did not change the direction of development of american society, nor did they aspire to do so. they only freed the development of american society from the retarding effect of british rule. their political reform did not change any basic trend, but only pushed american political culture along its natural direction of development. british society, of which american society was an offshoot, had been moving for a long time in the direction of representative democracy. and prior to the war of independence the americans were already practicing a significant degree of representative democracy in the colonial assemblies. the political system established by the constitution was modeled on the british system and on the colonial assemblies. with major alteration, to be sure -- there is no doubt that the founding fathers took a very important step. but it was a step along the road that english-speaking world was already traveling. the proof is that britain and all of its colonies that were populated predominantly by people of british descent ended up with systems of representative democracy essentially similar to that of the united states. if the founding fathers had lost their nerve and declined to sign the declaration of independence, our way of life today would not have been significantly different. maybe we would have had somewhat closer ties to britain, and would have had a parliament and prime minister instead of a congress and president. no big deal. thus the american revolution provides not a counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them. still, one has to use common sense in applying the principles. they are expressed in imprecise language that allows latitude for interpretation, and exceptions to them can be found. so we present these principles not as inviolable laws but as rules of thumb, or guides to thinking, that may provide a partial antidote to naive ideas about the future of society. the principles should be borne constantly in mind, and whenever one reaches a conclusion that conflicts with them one should carefully reexamine one’s thinking and retain the conclusion only if one has good, solid reasons for doing so. the foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult it would be to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom. there has been a consistent tendency, going back at least to the industrial revolution for technology to strengthen the system at a high cost in individual freedom and local autonomy. hence any change designed to protect freedom from technology would be contrary to a fundamental trend in the development of our society. consequently, such a change either would be a transitory one -- soon swamped by the tide of history -- or, if large enough to be permanent would alter the nature of our whole society. this by the first and second principles. moreover, since society would be altered in a way that could not be predicted in advance (third principle) there would be great risk. changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system. so any attempts at reform would be too timid to be effective. even if changes large enough to make a lasting difference were initiated, they would be retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent. thus, permanent changes in favor of freedom could be brought about only by persons prepared to accept radical, dangerous and unpredictable alteration of the entire system. in other words by revolutionaries, not reformers. people anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed benefits of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of society that would reconcile freedom with technology. apart from the fact that people who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the new form of society could be set up in the first place, it follows from the fourth principle that even if the new form of society could be once established, it either would collapse or would give results very different from those expected. so even on very general grounds it seems highly improbable that any way of changing society could be found that would reconcile freedom with modern technology. in the next few sections we will give more specific reasons for concluding that freedom and technological progress are incompatible. as explained in paragraphs 65-67, 70-73, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations, and his fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose decisions he cannot influence. this is not accidental or a result of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. it is necessary and inevitable in any technologically advanced society. the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function. at work people have to do what they are told to do, otherwise production would be thrown into chaos. bureaucracies have to be run according to rigid rules. to allow any substantial personal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion. it is true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated, but generally speaking the regulation of our lives by large organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrialtechnological society. the result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person. it may be, however, that formal regulations will tend increasingly to be replaced by

(propaganda, educational techniques, ""mental health"" programs, etc.) 115. the system has to force people to behave in ways that are increasingly remote from the natural pattern of human behavior. for example, the system needs scientists, mathematicians and engineers. it can't function without them. so heavy pressure is put on children to excel in these fields. it isn't natural for an adolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time sitting at a desk absorbed in study. a normal adolescent wants to spend his time in active contact with the real world. among primitive peoples the things that children are trained to do tend to be in reasonable harmony with natural human impulses. among the american indians, for example, boys were trained in active outdoor pursuits — just the sort of things that boys like. but in our society children are pushed into studying technical subjects, which most do grudgingly. 116. because of the constant pressure that the system exerts to modify human behavior, there is a gradual increase in the number of people who cannot or will not adjust to society's requirements: welfare leeches, youth- gang members, cultists, anti-government rebels, radical environmentalist saboteurs, dropouts and resisters of various kinds. 117. in any technologically advanced society the individual's fate must depend on decisions that he personally cannot influence to any great extent. a technological society cannot be broken down into small, autonomous communities, because production depends on the cooperation of very large numbers of people and machines. such a society must be highly organized and decisions have to be made that affect very large numbers of people. when a decision affects, say, a million people, then each of the affected individuals has, on the average, only a one-millionth share in making the decision. what usually happens in practice is that decisions are made by public officials or corporation executives, or by technical specialists, but even when the public votes on a decision the number of voters ordinarily is too large for the vote of anyone individual to be significant. thus most individuals are unable to influence measurably the major decisions that affect their lives. there is no conceivable way to remedy this in a technologically advanced society. the system tries to ""solve"" this problem by using propaganda to make people want the decisions that have been made for them, but even if this ""solution"" were completely successful in making people feel better, it would be demeaning. 118. conservatives and some others advocate more ""local autonomy."" local communities once did have autonomy, but such autonomy becomes less and less possible as local communities become more enmeshed with and dependent on large-scale systems like public utilities, computer networks, highway systems, the mass communications media and the modern health-care system. also operating against autonomy is the fact that technology applied in one location often affects people at other locations far away. thus pesticide or chemical use near a creek may contaminate the water supply hundreds of miles downstream, and the greenhouse effect affects the whole world. 119. the system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. instead, it is human behavior that has to be modifi ed to fit the needs of the system. this has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system. it is not the fault of capitalism and it is not the fault of socialism. it is the fault of technology, because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity. of course the system does satisfy many human needs, but generally speaking it does this only to the extent that it is to the advantage of the system to do it. it is the needs of the system that are paramount, not those of the human being. for example, the system provides people with food because the system couldn't function if everyone starved; it attends to people's psychological needs whenever it can conveniently do so, because it couldn't function if too many people became depressed or rebellious. but the system, for good, solid, practical reasons, must exert constant pressure on people to mold their behavior to the needs of the system. too much waste accumulating? the government, the media, the educational system, environmentalists, everyone inundates us with a mass of propaganda about recycling. need more technical personnel? a chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science. no one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects that most of them hate. when skilled workers are put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo ""retraining,"" no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way. it is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity. and for good reason: if human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems, unemployment, shortages or worse. the concept of ""mental health"" in our society is defi ned largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress. 120. efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within the system are no better than a joke. for example, one company, instead of having each of its employees assemble only one section of a catalogue, had each assemble a whole catalogue, and this was supposed to give them a sense of purpose and achievement. some companies have tried to give their employees more autonomy in their work, but for practical reasons this usually can be done only to a very limited extent, and in any case employees are never given autonomy as to ultimate goals — their ""autonomous"" efforts can never be directed toward goals that they select personally, but only toward their employer's goals, such as the survival and growth of the company. any company would soon go out of business if it permitted its employees to act otherwise. similarly, in any enterprise within a socialist system, workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of the enterprise, otherwise the enterprise will not serve its purpose as part of the system. once again, for purely technical reasons it is not possible for most individuals or small groups to have much autonomy in industrial society. even the small-business owner commonly has only limited autonomy. apart from the necessity of government regulation, he is restricted by the fact that he must fit into the economic system and conform to its requirements. for instance, when someone develops a new technology, the small-business person often has to use that technology whether he wants to or not, in order to remain competitive. 121. a further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor of freedom is that modern technology is a unified system in which all parts are dependent on one another. you can't get rid of the ""bad"" parts of technology and retain only the ""good"" parts. take modern medicine, for example. progress in medical science depends on progress in chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and other fields. advanced medical treatments require expensive, high-tech equipment that can be made available only by a technologically progressive, economically rich society. clearly you can't have much progress in medicine without the whole technological system and everything that goes with it. 122. even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest of the technological system, it would by itself bring certain evils. suppose for example that a cure for diabetes is discovered. people with a genetic tendency to diabetes will then be able to survive and reproduce as well as anyone else. natural selection against genes for diabetes will cease and such genes will spread throughout the population. (this may be occurring to some extent already, since diabetes, while not curable, can be controlled through the use of insulin.) the same thing will happen with many other diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic factors (e.g., childhood cancer), resulting in massive genetic degradation of the population. the only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic engineering of human beings, so that man in the future will no longer be a creation of nature, or of chance, or of god (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product. 123. if you think that big government interferes in your life too much now, just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your children. such",21.74

(also, see paragraphs 227-230.) 8. even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn't seem to be any remedy for this. all we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. we by no means claim to be telling the whole truth about leftist psychology. also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. we leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 9. the two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call feelings of inferiority and oversocialization. feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential. 10. by ""feelings of inferiority"" we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits: low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. we argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed), and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism. 11. when someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies), we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. this tendency is pronounced among minority-rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. they are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. the terms ""negro,"" ""oriental,"" ""handicapped,"" or ""chick"" for an african, an asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. ""broad"" and ""chick"" were merely the feminine equivalents of ""guy,"" ""dude"" or ""fellow. ""the negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word ""pet"" and insist on its replacement by ""animal companion."" leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. they want to replace the word ""primitive"" by ""nonliterate.'""they seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (we do not mean to imply that primitive cultures are inferior to ours. we merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.) 12. those who are most sensitive about ""politically incorrect"" terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any ""oppressed"" group but come from privileged strata of society. political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle to upper-class families. 13. many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (american indians), repellent (homosexuals), or otherwise inferior. the leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. they would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (we do not mean to suggest that women, indians, etc., are inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.) 14. feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may not be as strong and as capable as men. 15. leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. they hate america, they hate western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. the reasons that leftists give for hating the west, etc., clearly do not correspond with their real motives. they say they hate the west because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them,or at best he grudgingly admits that they exist; whereas he enthusiastically points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in western civilization. thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist's real motive for hating america and the west. he hates america and the west because they are strong and successful. 16. words like ""self-confidence,"" ""self -reliance, """"initiative,"" ""enterprise,"" ""optimism,"" etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. the leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. he wants society to solve everyone's problems for them, satisfy everyone's needs for them, take care of them. he is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. the leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser. 17. art forms that appeal",20.85

"" the worldview of most members of the upper middle class, including most intellectuals, is deeply dependent on the existence of a thoroughly organized, culturally ""advanced,"" large-scale society characterized by a high level of social order. it would be extremely difficult psychologically for such people to recognize that the only way to get off the road to disaster that we are now on would be through a total collapse of organized society and therefore a descent into chaos. so they cling to any scheme, however unrealistic, that promises to preserve the society on which their lives and their worldview are dependent; and one suspects that the threat to their worldview is more important to them than the threat to their lives. chapter two why the technological system will destroy itself we were recently entertained by a na'ive fable of the happy arrival of the 'end of history,' of the overflowing triumph of an all-democratic bliss; the ultimate global arrangement had supposedly been attained. but we all see and sense that something very different is coming, something new, and perhaps quite stern. -aleksandr solzhenitsyn power is in nature the essential measure of right. -ralph waldo emerson i. most of the arguments set forth elsewhere in this book are reasonably solid, but in the present chapter we go out on a limb both in making assumptions and in drawing inferences from them. we think our assumptions and inferences contain at least as much truth as they need to contain for the purpose of reaching certain probable conclusions about the future of human society, but we acknowledge that rational disagreement with our reasoning is possible. two things, however, can be definitely asserted: first, that our assumptions and inferences are reasonably accurate as applied to the development up to the present time of large-scale, complex societies; second, that anyone who wants to understand the likely future development of modern society will have to give careful attention to problems of the kind that are raised by the arguments of this chapter. though we focus here on the processes of competition and natural selection as they operate in complex societies, it is important to avoid confusing our viewpoint with the (now largely defunct) philosophy known as ""social darwinism."" social darwinism didn't merely call attention to natural selection as a factor in the development of societies; it also assumed that the winners in the contest of ""survival of the fittest"" were better, more desirable human beings than the losers were: [t]he competitive struggle of business was viewed a s a contest in which the survivors were the 'fittest'-not merely as businessmen, but as champions of civilization itself. hence businessmen transformed their sense of material superiority into a sense of moral and intellectual superiority . . . . social darwinism became a means of excusing as well as explaining the competitive process from which some emerged with power and some were ground into poverty. here our purpose is merely to describe the role that natural selection plays in the development of societies. we do not mean to suggest any favorable value-judgment concerning the winners in the struggle for power. ii. this chapter deals with self-propagating systems. by a selfpropagating system (self-prop system for short) we mean a system that tends to promote its own survival and propagation. a system may propagate itself in either or both of two ways: the system may indefinitely increase its own size and/or power, or it may give rise to new systems that possess some of its own attributes. the most obvious examples of self-propagating systems are biological organisms. groups of biological organisms can also constitute self-prop systems; e.g., wolf packs or hives of honeybees. particularly important for our purposes are self-prop systems that consist of groups of human beings. for example, nations, corporations, labor unions, churches, and political parties; also some groups that are not clearly delimited and lack formal organization, such as schools of thought, social networks, and subcultures. just as wolfpacks and beehives are self-propagating without any conscious intention on the part of wolves or bees to propagate their packs or their hives, there is no reason why a human group cannot be self-propagating independently of any intention on the part of the individuals who comprise the group. if a and b are systems of any kind (self-propagating or not), and if a is a functioning component of b, then we will call a a subsystem ofb, and we will call b a supersystem of a. for example, in human hunting-and-gathering societies, nuclear families belong to bands, and bands often are organized into tribes. nuclear families, bands, and tribes are all self-prop systems. the nuclear family is a subsystem of the band, the band is a subsystem of the tribe, the tribe is a supersystem of each band that belongs to it, and each band is a supersystem of every nuclear family that belongs to that band. it is also true that each nuclear family is a subsystem of the tribe and that the tribe is a supersystem of every nuclear family that belongs to a band that belongs to the tribe. the principle of natural selection is operative not only in biology, but in any environment in which self-propagating systems are present. the principle can be stated roughly as follows: those self-propagating systems having the traits that best suit them to survive and propagate themselves tend to survive and propagate themselves better than other self-propagating systems. this of course is an obvious tautology, so it tells us nothing new. but it can serve to call our attention to factors that we might otherwise overlook. we are about to advance several propositions that are not tautologies. we can't prove these propositions, but they are intuitively plausible and they seem consistent with the observable behavior of self-propagating systems as represented by biological organisms and human (formal or informal) organizations. in short, we believe these propositions to be true, or as close to the truth as they need to be for present purposes. proposition 1. in any environment that is sufficiently rich, selfpropagating systems will arise, and natural selection will lead to the evolution of self-propagating systems having increasingly complex, subtle, and sophisticated means of surviving and propagating themselves. it needs to be emphasized that natural selection doesn't merely act in simple ways, as by making the legs of deer longer so that they can run faster or giving arctic mammals thicker coats of fur so that they can stay warm. natural selection can also lead to the development of complex structures such as the human eye or heart, and to systems of far greater complexity that still are not fully understood, such as the human immune system or nervous system. we maintain that natural selection can lead to equally complex and subtle developments in self-prop systems consisting of human groups. natural selection operates relative to particular periods of time. let's start at some given point",24.19

contradiction"" in any situation, and this one principal contradiction commonly will point to a single, decisive objective that a movement needs to achieve in order to transform a society. in any conflict situation in which victory is uncertain, it is always essential to concentrate one's efforts on the achievement of the single most critical objective. military practitioners and theorists like napoleon and clausewitz recognized the importance of concentrating one's forces at the decisive point, and lenin noted that this principle applies in politics as it does in war. but we shouldn't need napoleon, clausewitz, or lenin to tell us this-it's just common sense: when you're facing a difficult struggle and have no strength to spare, you'd better concentrate what strength you have where it will do the most good: on the single most critical objective. rule (ii) if a movement aims to transform a society, then the objective selected by the movement must be of such a nature that, once the objective has been achieved, its consequences will be irreversible. this means that, once society has been transformed through the achievement of the objective, society will remain in its transformed condition without any further effort on the part of the movement or anyone else. in order to transform society, the movement will have to acquire great power and therefore, according to postulate 4, will soon become corrupt. once corrupted, the members of the movement or their successors will no longer exert themselves to maintain the transformed condition of society that corresponds to the ideals of the movement, but will be concerned only to gain and hold personal advantages. consequently, society will not remain in its transformed condition unless the transformation is irreversible. rule (iii) once an objective has been selected, it is necessary to persuade some small minority to commit itself to the achievement of the objective by means more potent than mere preaching or advocacy of ideas. in other words, the minority will have to organize itself for practical action. as pointed out in postulate 2, the advocacy of ideas alone cannot change society, so some group will have to be organized for the purpose of applying methods more potent than mere advocacy of ideas. at least at the outset, this group will ordinarily include only a very small minority because, again by postulate 2, prior to the application of methods more potent than the mere advocacy of ideas, only a very small minority can be persuaded to act. rule (iv) in order to keep itself faithful to its objective, a radical movement should devise means of excluding from its ranks all unsuitable persons who may seek to join it. this can be important, because according to postulate 3 the admission of unsuitable persons will promote the blurring or perversion of the movement's objective. rule (v) once a revolutionary movement has become powerful enough to achieve its objective, it must achieve its objective as soon as possible, and in any case before the original revolutionaries (meaning those who joined the movement while it was still relatively weak) die or become politically inactive. as noted earlier, the movement will have to become very powerful in order to achieve its objective, therefore, by postulate 4, it will soon be corrupted. once corrupted, the movement will no longer be faithful to its objective, so if the objective is to be achieved at all it must be achieved before the movement becomes corrupt. ii. examination of the postulates let's take a careful look at the postulates and ask ourselves to what extent they are true. postulate 1. to see the truth of this postulate, we don't need to rely on the opinion of the experienced activist quoted above. it should be obvious that vague or abstract goals can't ordinarily serve as a basis for effective action. for example, ""freedom"" by itself will not serve as a goal, because different people have different conceptions of what constitutes freedom and of the relative importance of different aspects of freedom. consequently, effective and consistent cooperation in pursuit of an unspecified ""freedom"" is impossible. the same is true of other vague goals like ""equality,"" ""justice"" or ""protecting the environment."" for effective cooperation you need a clear and concrete goal, so that everyone involved will have approximately the same understanding of what the goal actually is. moreover, where an objective is vague or abstract, it is too easy to pretend that the objective has been achieved, or that progress toward it is being made, when real achievements are minimal. for example, american politicians automatically identify ""freedom"" with the american way of life regardless of the realities of day-to-day living in this country. anything done to protect so-called american interests abroad is described as ""defending freedom,"" and many americans, probably the majority, actually accept this description. for the foregoing reasons, it is usually true that a radical movement cannot pursue vague or abstract goals successfully. but is it always true? maybe not. look, for example, at the american revolution. by may 1776 at the latest, the great majority of the american revolutionaries had accepted independence from britain as their objective of highest priority. this objective was clear and concrete, and it was achieved. but independence was not the revolutionaries' only goal: they also wanted to set up a ""republican"" government in america. this was by no means a clear and concrete objective, since widely differing forms of government can be described as ""republican."" consequently, once independence had been achieved, there were intense disagreements among the revolutionaries over the precise form of the ""republic"" that was to be established. nevertheless, the revolutionaries did succeed in setting up a government that was unquestionably republican in form and that has lasted to the present day. notice, however, that the revolutionaries did not set up a successful republican government until they had already won independence from britain and no longer faced stiff opposition. furthermore, they enjoyed certain special advantages: they had as a model a form of governmentthe english one-that was already halfway to being a republic. qefferson referred to the english constitution as a ""kind of half-way house"" between monarchy and ""liberty."") the revolutionaries shared a common heritage of relatively ""advanced"" political ideas derived from english tradition and from the works of enlightenment philosophers. england, moreover, had long been moving in the direction of representative democracy, so the american revolutionaries were only accelerating what was already a well established historical trend. and they were not accelerating it so very much, since the government they set up was still far from being fully democratic. in part iii of this chapter we will see other examples in which movements have succeeded in reaching vague or abstract goals. but we know of no well-defined examples of this kind in which the movement has faced stiff opposition and has not been favored by a pre-existing historical trend. it would be rash to conclude that a movement can never achieve vague or abstract goals against stiff opposition and without the help of a pre-existing historical trend. but it remains true that a movement that lacks a clear and concrete goal operates under a very heavy disadvantage. the stronger the opposition that a movement has to face, the more important it is that the movement should be united and able to concentrate all its energy on achieving a single objective; and this requires an objective that is clearly defined. yet, even in those situations in which the need for a clear and concrete objective is greatest, postulate 1 does not imply that abstract goals are useless. abstract goals often play an essential role in motivating and justifying a movement's concrete objective. to take a crude example, an aspiration for ""freedom"" may motivate and justify a movement that seeks to overthrow a dictator. postulate 2 is a matter of common, everyday experience. we all know how useless it is to try to change people's behavior by preaching to them-generally speaking. actually there are some important exceptions to postulate 2, but before we discuss those we need to point out that some seeming exceptions are not really exceptions at all. it would be a mistake, for example, to suppose that the teachings of jesus christ have been effective in guiding human behavior. it seems that the earliest christians did try to live in accord with the teachings of]esus (as they interpreted them), but at that stage the christians comprised only a tiny minority. with the passage of years, the christian way of life was progressively vitiated in proportion to the growing number of christians, and by the time christianity had become dominant in the roman empire few christians still lived as those of the first century ad had done. the world went on as before, full of war, lust, greed, and treachery. what happened, of course, was that christian doctrines were reinterpreted to suit the convenience of the society that existed at any given stage of history. thus, during the carolingian era, when western europe hardly had a money",24.19

and if any of these evils could be eliminated, the growth of the technological system would be retarded and its negative consequences somewhat mitigated. capitalism, for instance, is at present the economic system that is most conducive to technological development, so if you could get rid of capitalism you would to some extent slow technological progress; in addition, you would reduce economic inequality. globalization contributes to economic and technological efficiency because there are obvious advantages to a system in which natural, human, and technical resources can be freely transferred from any one part of the world to any other part where they may be needed. so if you could do away with globalization and isolate each region of the world economically from all the others, technological progress would b e significantly slowed. centralization too is important to technological progress. for example, in order to keep the u. s. economy functioning properly there has to be some central authority to regulate banking, print money, and so forth, otherwise the u. s. would experience the same difficulties as did germany prior to its unification, when much of the country was still divided into numerous small, independent states, each with its own banking regulations, its own currency, its own weights and measures, etc. as many petty states as there were, . . . so many were the different civil and criminal codes, so many the different kinds of coins and banknotes, so many the different military, financial, and transportation-related institutions . . . . the citizen ofwiirttemberg needed a passport to travel to baden. for a stay in koburg-gotha, braunschweig, or schwarzburg-rudolstadt, the citizen of baden needed to exchange his money. for normal economic development, the financial and commercial regulation of germany had to undergo a centralizing process that spanned most of the 19th century. if centralization could somehow be reversed in germany-or in the u. s . or any other country-economic growth and technological progress there would be significantly impeded. so why not attack centralization? first, it would be exceedingly difficult to attack centralization successfully. an organization or a movement would have to concentrate all its energy on that attack, and even if it succeeded in substantially reducing centralization the result would be only to slow technological progress to a certain extent; neither the technological system nor the principal evils associated with it would be eliminated. thus, in attacking centralization the movement would use its resources inefficiently: it would expend vast energy in the hope of only a modest gain. worse still, by concentrating its energy on the campaign against centralization, the movement would distract attention (its own and other people's) from the most important target, which is the technological system itself. in any case, an attack on centralization could not be successful. of course, there is no special difficulty about decentralizing in situations where centralization has proven to be economically inefficient. e.g., excessive centralized control over economic activity, otherwise known as socialism, has largely died out due to its inefficiency. but where centralization promotes efficiency, its prevalence is guaranteed by a process of natural selection. systems that are more centralized (in aspects in which centralization contributes to efficiency) thrive better than those systems that are less centralized; hence, the former tend to expand at the expense of the latter. since inefficiency imposes economic and other hardships on people, most will oppose decentralization. even the majority of those who now hold a negative view of centralization would oppose decentralization when they found out what it cost them in terms of efficiency. for example, if you wanted to let each state of the union establish its own monetary policy and print its own currency independently of all the other states, your proposal would be dismissed as ridiculous. even if you somehow succeeded in putting such a measure into effect, the negative consequences-monetary chaos and so forth-would outrage so many people that centralized control in monetary matters would soon be reinstated. needless to say, if future developments should ever make centralized systems economically and technologically inefficient in comparison with less centralized ones, then it will be relatively easy to decentralize. but in that event your attack on centralization will be promoting technological progress rather than retarding it. in either case, attacking centralization is not an effective way of resisting technological progress. arguments very similar to the foregoing apply to any effort to eliminate capitalism. to have any hope of eliminating capitalism a movement would have to concentrate all its energy on that task, and even if it succeeded in eliminating capitalism the gain would be very modest, because technological progress would continue, though at a somewhat slower rate. there was no capitalism in the soviet union, for example, yet that country was by no means a negligible force technologically. even before world war ii the soviets were among the leaders in nuclear physics; their mig 15 jet fighter shocked western forces in the korean war with its speed and agility; the soviets were the first to develop a really successful jet airliner, the tu-104; and the soviet union was the first nation to put an artificial satellite into orbit. thus, an antitechnological movement that focused on the elimination of capitalism would gain little in return for an enormous expenditure of energy. what is worse, by focusing on capitalism the movement would distract its own and other people's attention from the far more important objective of bringing down the technological system itself. an attack on capitalism moreover would be futile, or would be successful only temporarily and in a few countries at most. capitalism has become the world's dominant economic system through a process of natural selection; it has replaced other systems because under present-day conditions capitalism is economically and technologically more efficient. for this reason, even if you could get rid of capitalism in some countries, these would tend strongly to revert to capitalist economic structures as the relative inefficiency of their non-capitalist systems became apparent. this has been demonstrated through experience: when the socialist countries of eastern europe couldn't keep up with the west economically or technologically, they adopted capitalist systems. sweden once was ideologically socialist, but in practical terms socialism never got very far in that country. today sweden is still a capitalist welfare-state-and is becoming less of a welfare state as it reduces benefits in the interest of economic efficiency. china remains nominally socialist, but for the sake of economic success the chinese government now allows a great deal of private enterprise, i.e., capitalism. in nicaragua the sandinistas still pretend to be socialist, but in reality they are turning to capitalism. this writer knows of only two countries left in the world that are free of capitalism: cuba and north korea. no one wants to imitate cuba or north korea, because they are economic failures. and that's why cuba is now (2011) taking some timid steps in the direction of capitalism. so it's clear that as long as we live in a technological world we will never get rid of capitalism unless and until it is superseded by some system that is economically and technologically more efficient. the arguments i've outlined here in reference to centralization and capitalism are equally applicable to globalization, bureaucracy, big, intrusive governments, environmental recklessness, and any number of other evils the elimination of which would merely impair the efficiency of the technological system while still permitting it to grow. as long as society remains saturated with the values of the technological system, most people will not accept any measures that seriously impede the functioning of that system. in order to get people to accept such measures, you would first have to convince them that the supposed ""benefits"" of modern technology are not worth the price that has to be paid for them. thus, your ideological attack must be focused on modern technology itself. an attempt to eliminate capitalism, globalization, centralization or any other subordinate evil can only distract attention from the need to eliminate the entire technological system. appendix four the long-term outcome of geo-engineering in 2009, a correspondent asked me whether i thought nuclear weapons were the most dangerous aspect of modern technology. what follows is my reply, heavily rewritten. the most dangerous aspect of modern technology probably is not nuclear weapons. it could plausibly be argued that the remedies for global warming that are likely to be adopted constitute the most dangerous aspect of modern technology. nations have a strong incentive to avoid using nuclear weapons, at least on any large scale, because such use would probably be suicidal. this doesn't mean that nuclear war can never happen. on the contrary, the",22.39

""but lenin did not despair of success . . . . for him there were lessons to be learned, new plans to be worked out, alternate methods of revolution to be considered."" again in 1914, at the outbreak of world war i, ""the revolutionary movement died down . . . . the revolutionary ideas were barely kept glowing in small and hushed circles. in the factories in those days nobody dared to call himself 'bolshevik' for fear not only of arrest, but of a beating from the backward workers."" as we mentioned earlier (section 10), the bolsheviks' centralized organization was destroyed at this time through the arrest of their delegates in the duma. nevertheless the bolsheviks persisted, and following the february 1917 insurrection and the implementation of lenin's ""april theses"" they made themselves into an important force in the russian revolutionary process. however, as a result of the ""july days"" (the abortive insurrection of july 1917; see section 12, above) the bolsheviks again suffered a severe setback, one that would have been fatal to a less determined group. 'after the july days,' writes v yakovleva, at that time a member of the central committee . . . , 'all reports from the localities described with one voice not only a sharp decline in the mood of the masses, but even a definite hostility to our party. in a good number of cases our speakers were beaten up. the membership fell off rapidly, and several organizations . . . even ceased to exist entirely.' .. . the efflux from the party in some cases reached such a scale that only after a new registration of members could the organization begin to live a proper life. we've emphasized that any major defeat is dangerous. but if a revolutionary organization has a hard core that is absolutely committed and determined, the organization in some cases may actually be strengthened by a defeat because its weaker members are weeded out: if they don't leave the organization, they at least reveal themselves by their wavering during the period of failures and difficulties. thus the hard core is consolidated, because its members are clearly distinguished from the weaker members of the organization. trotsky notes in reference to the july days: this sharp turn in the mood of the masses produced an automatic, and moreover an unerring, selection within the cadres of the party. those [bolsheviks] who did not tremble in those days could be relied on absolutely in what was to come. they constituted a nucleus in the shops, in the factories, in the districts. on the eve of [the bolshevik seizure of power in october 1917] , in making appointments and allotting tasks, the organizers would glance round many a time calling to mind who bore himself how in the july in this way the bolsheviks drew an advantage from their july defeat when the time came for them to take control of russia. but just a few months after their seizure of power they again came close to total defeat with the invasion of the ""white"" counterrevolutionaries and their western allies: [t]he bolsheviks were about to fall. it seemed a matter of days. ruin surrounded them, from the pacific and all across siberia and the urals, their power had collapsed. the germans were in charge in the ukraine, where a voluntary army was forming against the bolsheviks, and the english were landing in the north. as was famine. in these circumstances, nothing but the unbreakable determination of the hard core of the bolshevik party enabled it to survive. but it did survive, and it retained its iron grip on russia for more than sixty years thereafter. this ability to bounce back from severe defeats is a trait that seems characteristic of successful revolutionary leaders. the trait is delineated with particular clarity in the case of fidel castro. matthews emphasizes ""fidel's incorrigible optimism and fighting spirit"" : 'the most important feature of fidel's character,' his brother raul said to me . . . , 'is that he will not accept defeat.' every phase of his life, from childhood to the present, proves this point . . . . fidel never gave up; he never lost heart; he seems immune to discouragement and dismay. fidel castro was like lenin in having the gift of inspiring all those around him by his faith in himself and in what he was doing . . . . [l]t showed up best in the worst and apparently most hopeless periods. 23. in these pages we may seem to be making heroes of such men as robert bruce, lenin, mao, castro, the extreme irish nationalists, and so forth. certainly the deeds of all these people were of heroic magnitude. but this doesn't mean that we should admire them as human beings, still less that we should respect their goals or their values. the bolshevik communist leaders were committed technophiles, and therefore the adversaries of those of us who believe that modern technology is pushing the world toward disaster. robert bruce may (or may not) have made some pretense of patriotic motives, but in all probability his real motive was personal ambition -he wanted to be king of scotland-and in the service of that ambition he inflicted terrible cruelties not only on the english but even on some of his fellow scotsmen. in the twentieth century, as we pointed out in chapter three, there was no reason why ireland needed to become independent of britain. it was solely in order to satisfy their own psychological needs that the irish nationalists provoked the war of independence that brought suffering and death to so many of their countrymen, and the irish are no better off today than they would have been if ireland had remained part of the united kingdom. here we've taken notice of some of the revolutionaries of the past only because we can learn something from their experience and their methods. if we've cited communist leaders more often than others, we've done so not from any sympathy for communism but only because the communists, by and large, have been the most effective and successful revolutionaries of the 20th century. 24. professional propagandists know that people usually accept only those new ideas that they are already predisposed to accept. a revolutionary movement should try to identify the sectors of the population whose members are most likely to be predisposed to accept the revolutionary message, and should give special attention to those sectors in propagating its ideas and in its efforts at recruitment. nevertheless, anti-tech ideas should be made known not only to the predisposed sectors but to the population at large. the rule that only predisposed people accept new ideas is not necessarily applicable ""in times of revolutionary crisis when old beliefs have been shattered."" thus, as we pointed out in section 8, when a severe crisis of the system arrives the revolutionary movement will have its opportunity to acquire a mass following; but a mass following will be more easily acquired if most people already have at least some superficial acquaintance with anti-tech ideas. moreover, even long before the arrival of a crisis and even in sectors where the revolutionaries cannot hope to win any active support, their message can promote discontent and disillusionment and thus help",15.8

(whether these democracies survive is another question, as we've seen.) but the french revolutionaries of the 1790s were unable to set up a properly functioning democratic government promptly. the exact point at which the french revolution was corrupted may be open to argument, but certainly it had been corrupted by the time napoleon became first consul. when that happened, it was too late to establish a representative democracy. in mexico following the revolution of 1910-1920, the revolutionaries did not bring social justice to the peasants all at once but sought ""a more conservative evolution . . . and more stability in government."" progress toward social justice for the peasants essentially ended in 1940 when lazaro cardenas, one of the original revolutionaries, concluded his term as president. thus, delay in fulfillment of the revolutionary ideal prevented its complete fulfillment. even the partial fulfillment of the ideal that had been achieved was largely reversed under president salinas de gortari (1988-1994). in england and the united states the feminist movement achieved its central goal-woman suffrage-as soon as it was powerful enough to do so. since then the feminist movement, though splintered into various factions, has remained sufficiently powerful to make continued progress toward total equality for women, as described earlier in this chapter, but, as far as this writer knows, the movement has not been seriously corrupted in the sense of allowing the personal ambitions of its members or its leaders to supersede the movement's ideal of equality of the sexes. however, rule (v) refers to revolutionary movements, and feminism today is not a revolutionary movement. when it emerged during the first half of the 19th century feminism might perhaps have been called revolutionary, since immediate implementation of the feminists' demands would have entailed a fairly radical alteration of society. but, as noted earlier, feminism was favored by the historical trend toward ""equality"" in general, and by the time feminists acquired the right to vote in the 1920s their movement could no longer be considered revolutionary; one would hardly say that the achievement of woman suffrage caused a social earthquake. still less is the feminists' goal of total gender equality a revolutionary one nowadays. because its goals have not been of revolutionary magnitude, the feminist movement has not had to grow powerful enough to become attractive to opportunists. membership in feminist organizations today does not in any substantial degree earn a woman such personal advantages as money, power, or social status. a woman seeking such advantages will enter a career in business, government, politics, or the professions, not in a feminist organization. thus postulate 4 and rule (v) do not apply. in the case of the irish nationalist movement the issue is somewhat complicated. by achieving dominion status in 1922 the nationalists reached the main part of their goal, and they reached it as soon as they were powerful enough to do so. it's not clear that it would be reasonable to say that the movement thereafter became corrupt in the sense of being no longer faithful to the goal, because the goal was already mostly achieved. yet, once the movement was in power, it split into two factions over the oath of allegiance to the british crown that members of the new irish parliament had to take. the more extreme faction, led by eamon de valera, regarded the members of the other faction (which accepted the oath) as sell-outs (as ""corrupted"" in our sense of the word) for giving in to the british on this largely symbolic issue. de valera's faction eventually came into power, but nevertheless remained faithful to its goal of total independence from britain until, by 1949, the objectionable oath had been eliminated, ireland had been formally declared a republic, and the last vestiges of political dependence on britain had disappeared. but all this took place under the leadership of de valera, who was one of the original revolutionaries. postulate 4 does not assert that a successful revolutionary movement is corrupted until all of its original leaders have become politically inactive. moreover, in another sense it could be argued that even de valera's faction of the irish nationalist movement was corrupted, for a certain fraction of ireland (""northern ireland"") remains tied to britain even today as part of the united kingdom.144 the original irish revolutionaries regarded such a partition of their country as unacceptable; their goal was independence for all of ireland. at least until 1998 , the republic of ireland maintained a nominal claim to sovereignty over northern ireland, but there were no efforts on the part of mainstream irish politicians to make that claim effective. these politicians, like politicians everywhere, have no doubt been concerned primarily with their own careers. (they are ""corrupt"" in our sense.) thus, having been unable to take northern ireland from the british soon after they acquired power, the irish nationalists lost that territory forever, or at least for the foreseeable future. there still exist offshoots of the original irish nationalist movement (sinn fein and the ira, the provisional ira, the real ira, the effective ira, or whatever the latest faction of a faction of a faction is called) that may be uncorrupted in the sense of remaining faithful to the goal of independence for all of ireland, but these offshoots do not have great power, hence postulate 4 does not apply to them. the reformation was not the work of a single movement but a complex event in which several theological movements, such as those of luther, zwingli, and calvin, competed with one another, and in which various princes participated for reasons that likely had more to do with their own practical advantage than with religious conviction.150 thus an examination of the reformation in relation to postulate 4 and rule (v) would be complicated and would require a detailed knowledge of the period. as we've seen from the examples reviewed here, our five rules are not to be taken as rigid laws that every radical movement must consciously obey on pain of total failure. in many situations the interpretation of the rules may be difficult and complicated, or the application of some of the rules may be impossible or unnecessary. the rules nevertheless are important because, at the least, they set forth problems that every radical movement needs to study carefully. a movement that does not consciously address the problems represented by the rules may possibly succeed through mere luck, but its chances of success will be very much less than those of a movement that takes the rules into consideration. in the next section we will see how present-day efforts to deal with the problems generated by modern technology, including the problem of environmental devastation, are doomed to failure through neglect of the five rules. iv. the application let's start with chellis glendinning's ""notes toward a neo-luddite manifesto,"" which can be found in an anthology compiled by david skrbina. glendinning's statement of the goals of neo-luddism is long and complicated, and most of the stated goals are hopelessly vague. here is a sample: we favor the creation ef technologies in which politics, morality, ecology, and technics are merged far the benefit ef life on earth: community-based energy sources utilizing solar, wind, and water technologies-which are renewable and enhance both community relations and respect for nature; organic, biological technologies . . . which derive directly from natural models and systems; conflict resolution technologies-which emphasize cooperation, understanding, and continuity of relationship; and decentralized social technologies-which encourage participation, responsibility, and empowerment . . . . we favor the development of a life-enhancing worldview in western technological societies. we hope to instill a perception of life, death, and human potential into technological societies that will integrate the human need for creative expression, spiritual experience and community with the capacity for rational thought and functionality. we perceive the human role not as the dominator of other species and planetary biology, but as integrated into the natural world with appreciation",24.59

it would be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or pickling, as was done before the invention of the refrigerator. 210. so it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken down, refrigeration technology would quickly be lost. the same is true of other organization-dependent technology. and once this technology had been lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild it, just as it took centuries to build it the first time around. surviving technical books would be few and scattered. an industrial society, if built from scratch without outside help, can only be built in a series of stages: you need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools a long process of economic development and progress in social organization is required. and, even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology, there is no reason to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial society. the enthusiasm for ""progress"" is a phenomenon peculiar to the modern form of society, and it seems not to have existed prior to the 17th century or thereabouts. 211. in the late middle ages there were four main civilizations that were about equally ""advanced"": europe, the islamic world, india, and the far east (china, japan, korea). three of these civilizations remained more or less stable, and only europe became dynamic. no one knows why europe became dynamic at that time; historians have their theories but these are only speculation. at any rate it is clear that rapid development toward a technological form of society occurs only under special conditions. so there is no reason to assume that a long-lasting technological regression cannot be brought about. 212. would society eventually develop again toward an industrial- technological form? maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can't predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time. 213. because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement, leftists or persons of similar psychological type often are attracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and membership are not initially leftist. the resulting influx of leftish types can easily turn a non-leftist movement into a leftist one, so that leftist goals replace or distort the original goals of the movement. 214. to avoid this, a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists. leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology. leftism is collectivist; it seeks to bind together the entire world (both nature and the human race) into a unified whole. but this implies management of nature and of human life by organized society, and it requires advanced technology. you can't have a united world without rapid long-distance transportation and communication, you can't make all people love one another without sophisticated psychological techniques, you can't have a ""planned society'without the necessary technological base. above all, leftism is driven by the need f or power, and the lef tist seeks power on a collective basis, through identification with a mass movement or an organization. leftism is unlikely ever to give up technology, because technology is too valuable a source of collective power. 215. the anarchist too seeks power, but he seeks it on an individual or small-group basis; he wants individuals and small groups to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives. he opposes technology because it makes small groups dependent on large organizations. 216. some leftists may seem to oppose technology, but they will oppose it only so long as they are outsiders and the technological system is controlled by non-leftists. if leftism ever becomes dominant in society, so that the technological system becomes a tool in the hands of leftists, they will enthusiaslically use it and promote its growth. in doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in the past. when the bolsheviks in russia were outsiders, they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police, they advocated self-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth; but as soon as they came into power themselves, they imposed a tighter censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that had existed under the tsars, and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done. in the united states, a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities, leftist professors were vigorous proponents of academic freedom, but today, in those of our universities where leftists have become dominant, they have shown themselves ready to take away everyone else's academic freedom. (this is ""political correctness."") the same will happen with leftists and technology: they will use it to oppress everyone else if they ever get it under their own control. 217. in earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type, repeatedly, have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries, as well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination, and later have double-crossed them to seize power for themselves. robespierre did this in the french revolution, the bolsheviks did it in the russian revolution, the communists did it in",21.74

(see paragraph 83.) 92. thus science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who provide the funds for research. 93. we are going to argue that industrial-technological society cannot be reformed in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing the sphere of human freedom. but because ""freedom"" is a word that can be interpreted in many ways, we must first make clear what kind of freedom we are concerned with. 94. by ""freedom"" we mean the opportunity to go through the power process, with real goals not the artifi cial goals of surrogate activities, and without interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone, especially from any large organization. freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a small group) of the life-and-death issues of one's existence: food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one's environment. freedom means having power; not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one's own life. one does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised. it is important not to conf use freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72). 95. it is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed rights. but these are not as important as they seem. the degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government. most of the indian nations of new england were monarchies, and many of the cities of the italian renaissance were controlled by dictators. but in reading about these societies one gets the impression that they allowed far more personal f reedom than out society does. in part this was because they lacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler's will: there were no modern, well-organized police forces, no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens. hence it was relatively easy to evade control. 96. as for our constitutional rights, consider for example that of freedom of the press. we certainly don't mean to knock that right; it is a very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. but freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. the mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. to make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. take us (fc) for example. if we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. if they had been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it's more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. even if these writings had had many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them. in order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression, we've had to kill people. 97. constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what might be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. according to the bourgeois conception, a ""free"" man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual. thus the bourgeois's ""free"" man has economic f reedom because that promotes growth and progress; he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders; he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. this was clearly the attitude of simon bolivar. to him, people deserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois). other bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a mere means to collective ends. chester c. tan, chinese political thought in the twentieth century, page 202, explains the philosophy of the kuomintang leader hu han-min: ""an individual is granted rights because he is a member of society and his community life requires such rights. by community hu meant the whole society or the nation."" and on page 259 tan states that according to carsun chang (chang chun-mai, head of the state socialist party in china) freedom had to be used in the interest of the state and of the people as a whole. but what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone else prescribes? fc's conception of freedom is not that of bolivar, hu, chang or other bourgeois theorists. the trouble with such theorists is that they have made the development and application of social theories their surrogate activity. consequently the theories are designed to serve the needs of the theorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the theories are imposed. 98. one more point to be made in this section: it should not be assumed that a person has enough freedom just because he says he has enough. freedom is restricted in part by psychological controls of which people are unconscious, and moreover many people's ideas of what constitutes freedom are governed more by social convention than by their real needs. for example, it's likely that many leftists of the oversocialized type would say that most people, including themselves, are socialized too little rather than too much, yet the oversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of socialization. 99. think of history as being the sum of two components: an erratic component that consists of unpredictable events that follow no discernible pattern, and a regular component that consists of long-term historical trends. here we are concerned with the long-term trends. 100. first principle. if a small change is made that affects a long-term historical trend, then the effect of that change will almost always be transitory — the trend will soon revert to its original state.

it is even believed that no modern nation could survive economically if it did not participate in international trade. but in the longer term such trade entails serious risks: [a] country that has become heavily involved in international trade has given hostages to fortune: a part of its industry has become dependent upon export markets for income and for employment. any cutoff of these foreign markets . . . would be acutely serious; and yet it would be a situation largely beyond the power of the domestic government involved to alter. similarly, another part of domestic industry may rely on an inflow of imported raw materials, such as oil for fuel and power. any restriction of these imports could have the most serious consequences; and reliance on the importation of manufactured goods too can be risky. it's possible that germany's dependence on international trade was a decisive factor in that country's defeat in world war i, for the british blockade was so effective in cutting off german trade that by the end of the war it had brought germany to the verge of starvation. on the other hand, britain's dependence on international trade would have led to a german victory in either world war i or world war ii if the british hadn't succeeded, with american help, in defeating germany's submarine campaign, for the u-boats would otherwise have starved britain into submission. what we see, therefore, is that for the sake of economic survival in the short term nations must take the risk of allowing themselves to become dependent on international trade, even though their dependence may have grave or even fatal consequences in the long run. it is currently believed that the united states is ""the most profligate or wasteful"" of all developed countries in its use and abuse of its natural resources. this has probably been true throughout u. s. history. in colonial times, american farming methods were recognized as highly improvident in comparison with european ones, and zimmermann points out the reckless and wasteful way in which, during the 1860s and 1870s, the fabled comstock lode in nevada was exhausted within twenty years, whereas, says zimmermann, a similar body of ore in europe would have provided thousands of miners with a livelihood for centuries. this was probably typical of american mining practices at the time. yet america's profligacy in the use of its natural resources didn't prevent it from becoming the world's dominant economic power. and the country that is now beginning to challenge america's dominance is china, which is notorious for its environmental irresponsibility. as these examples illustrate, reckless exploitation of natural resources can favor the achievement of power in the short term, however deadly its long-term consequences may be. b. in connection with propositions 4 and 5 of part ii of chapter two, we mentioned that pre-industrial empires stretching over vast distances ""actively created, if they did not already have, relatively rapid means of transportation and communication."" the egyptians had the nile. the romans relied heavily on water transport over the mediterranean and the rivers that flowed into it, and for overland travel they built their famous roads. imperial china had an extensive system of canals. the song (sung) dynasty ""maintained highways, with staffed stations, for official travel and a courier service network, the latter being an index of centralized government control,"" and moreover ""carried out a program of public works including construction and repair of roads, . . . bridges, . . . transport and communications facilities . . . . "" presumably other dynasties too did something of that sort. the mongol empire of chinggis (genghis) khan ""utilized homing pigeons as messengers"" and had ""an extensive system of messenger posts"" through which relays of riders carried messages at top speed. the incas maintained roads over which relays of runners could carry messages rapidly, while freight was transported on the backs of human porters or llamas. the maya never built an empire of any substantial extent, and their lack of developed facilities for long-distance transportation or communication probably had something to do with this. the aztecs likewise lacked developed facilities for long-distance transportation or communication, yet their ""empire"" at its peak measured roughly 500 miles in its maximum dimension, not counting the detached territory of soconusco. however, the aztec ""empire"" hardly deserved that name: conquered peoples could be forced to pay taxes or contribute troops for aztec campaigns, but in other respects centralized control was almost nonexistent. even at that, the ""empire"" had evidently reached the maximum geographical extent that was possible with the existing means of transportation and communication, and it was probably unstable, for revolts were frequent. c. it seems clear in general that internal dissension within large human groups tends to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of external threats or challenges to the group, so that a dramatic reduction of external threats or challenges tends to be followed by a marked increase in internal dissension. here, as so often elsewhere, ""clean"" historical examples are scarce, due to the complexity of historical developments in the real world. see note 7 to chapter two. but we offer four relatively clean examples: ""the general view of thinking romans was that the relaxation of external pressures"" due to ""the temporary end of the age of major wars (ca 130 bc)"" was what led to the ""internal disintegration"" of the roman republic. though the britannica seems uncertain, it's hard to believe that the relaxation of external pressures was not at least a contributing factor in the rise of internal conflict at rome. ""the landing of spanish troops near tampico [about 1829] rallied the [mexican] nation to a unified effort, and the intrepid general santa anna .. . defeated the invaders . . . . for a moment, the victory bolstered mexican national pride. but now the danger from abroad that had served to unite the country .. . vanished and internal dissensions took on a new and ugly face."" with the disappearance of the external danger from britain at the end of the american war of lndependence in 1783, ""disunity began to threaten to turn into disintegration . . . . the states were setting up their own tariff barriers against each other and quarreling among themselves . . . . "" this no doubt is why john adams (the future president) wrote not long after the end of the war that the united states needed an external enemy to protect it from the ""danger of dividing."" during the latter part ofworld war ii, when it had become clear that germany was irrevocably on the road to defeat, ""the anglo-american accord, which had held very strongly during the testing two and a half years of defeat followed by only peripheral attack, instead of being warmed by the sun of victory began badly to cool. . . .

it can probably be said of each of their other goals that either the goal would have been reached anyway through the operation of general historical trends and without any effort on the part of the nationalists; or the achievement of the goal was merely symbolic; or else the goal was achieved only in an incomplete form that would have been unsatisfactory to the original revolutionaries. one goal of the 19th-century irish revolutionaries was the relief of the peasants' misery, and the revolutionaries may have hastened the achievement of this goal insofar as the british fear of revolutionary violence made the task of reformers like parnell easier. but, as we've already pointed out, the eventual relief of the peasants' misery was guaranteed anyway by a pre-existing historical trend that prevailed throughout western europe. another goal of the extreme nationalists was the establishment of a ""republic."" this goal was a vague one since, as we mentioned in connection with the american revolution, a wide variety of states can be called ""republics."" constitutional monarchies such as britain, spain, or the netherlands are not technically republics, but in practical terms their systems differ little from those of undoubted republics like france or the united states. when ireland was officially declared a republic in 1949, little was changed; ""republic"" was hardly more than a word or a symbol. if the term ""republic"" were taken to mean ""representative democracy,"" we would say that ireland was already a republic in substance long before it became one officially. and, once the goal of independence was reached, ireland would have become a representative democracy anyway through the operation of pre-existing historical trends, just as every other country in western europe has become a representative democracy. and it is not certain that ireland has become a republic in a sense that would have satisfied the original revolutionaries, for at least some of these seem to have had something more socialistic in mind. in addition, the revolutionaries wanted to avoid ""anglicization"" of ireland and preserve irish language and culture. ln this it can't be said that the revolutionaries failed completely, but their success has been unimpressive at best. irish gaelic today is the first language of only a small fraction of the irish population. though it is taught in the schools and is ""more widely read, spoken, and understood [as of 2003] than during most of the 20th century,"" it seems unlikely that the majority of modern irish people are fluent in gaelic; for, among people who learn a language only in school, no more than a small minority ever become fluent in it. ireland is basically an english-speaking country, from which it follows that ireland must be subject to considerable cultural influence from other english-speaking countries. whether or not it is accurate to speak of an ""anglicization"" of ireland, there can be no doubt that ireland (with the possible exception of a few isolated areas that may not yet be fully modernized) has undergone the same cultural homogenization that has occurred in the rest ofwestern europe, and in all probability modern ireland differs culturally from other western european countries no more than these countries differ among themselves. it may well be that traditional arts, crafts, music, etc. are now practiced in ireland more than they would have been without the efforts of the nationalists, but it is certain that the basic culture of lreland today is the universal culture of modern industrial society. it follows that traditional arts and crafts can be no more than gimmicks that serve to entertain tourists or to give the irish themselves an illusion of temporary escape from the modern world. would this degree of linguistic and cultural preservation have satisfied the revolutionaries of the 19th and early 20th centuries? probably not. ""few irishmen today would accept that what irish nationalists have achieved represents a true fulfillment of that near-mystical ideal for which, in one form or another, irishmen had striven for so long."" thus, while it can't be said that the irish revolutionaries achieved no success at all in other areas, their one unmistakable and complete success was in reaching the single, clear, simple, and concrete goal that had been their main objective for several decades: to make ireland politically independent of britain. the examples of feminism and irish nationalism (among others) show that rule (i) cannot correctly be understood to mean that no social movement can ever achieve any success at all without concentrating exclusively on a single, clear, simple, concrete objective. but these and other examples that we've looked at do support the proposition that every movement that hopes to achieve something had better give careful consideration to rule (i) and should deviate from the rule only if there is a definite, strong, and convincing reason for doing so. rule (ii) states that if a movement aspires to transform a society, then the objective selected by the movement must be of such a nature that the social changes wrought by the achievement of the objective will be irreversible-meaning that the changes will survive even without any further effort on the part of the movement or anyone else. the reason is that the movement, once in power, will become ""corrupt""; i.e., will no longer be faithful to its earlier goals and ideals. for example, the feminists' achievement of woman suffrage is irreversible because (among other reasons) now that women have the right to vote, it cannot be taken away from them through democratic processes without the consent of most women-consent that they would hardly be likely to give even in the absence of an effective and uncorrupted feminist movement. of course, the feminists' achievement is not irreversible in any absolute sense. women could lose the right to vote in the event of some sweeping transformation of society, such as an end of the democratic form of government. the theocratic republic set up in geneva by calvin provides a probable example in which a movement achieved its objective and the associated social changes were later reversed due to corruption of the movement. what seems to happen more often, though, is that a movement becomes corrupt before it reaches its objective, so that the objective is never fully achieved in the first place. thus, in russia, the bolshevik/communist movement was corrupted while the construction of a socialist society was still in its early stages, so that the kind of socialist society envisioned by the original bolsheviks was never attained. the french revolution was corrupted before it even came close to creating the type of society envisioned by any of the revolutionary factions. this writer is not aware of even one unarguable example in which a revolutionary movement has concentrated its efforts on a single, clear, simple, concrete objective (as required by rule (i)) and has achieved the objective, and the achievement has subsequently been reversed due to corruption of the movement. once a clear, simple, concrete objective has been achieved, its achievement no doubt is less easily reversed than that of a vague or complex objective, because its reversal would be too obvious, too hard to disguise. this is another reason why a movement should obey rule (i). the establishment of a democratic government is not a very clear and precise objective, because there are considerable differences among the various kinds of government",31.25

""the high temper of the bolshevik party expressed itself not in an absence of disagreements, waverings, and even quakings, but in the fact that in the most difficult circumstances it gathered itselfin good season by means of inner crises, and made good its opportunity to interfere decisively in the course of events."" as always, the reader must remember that in the real world events are unpredictable. the preceding paragraphs provide only general guidelines, not rigid rules that can be applied mechanically. the guidelines may have to be modified to adapt them to the concrete situations that will arise in the practice of revolutionary politics. 13. one possible cause of hesitation on the part of revolutionaries needs to be addressed. some time ago this writer received a letter from an individual who asked whether revolutionaries should strive to bring about the collapse of the technological system even though the chaos attendant on the collapse would entail an increased risk of nuclear war. the answer is that revolutionaries should not be deterred by such a risk. first, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to unstable or irresponsible countries (e.g., pakistan, north korea, iran, possibly myanmar) continues and is unlikely to be permanently halted. consequently, the risk of nuclear war can only increase as long as the technological system survives, and the sooner the system collapses the less will be the risk of nuclear war in the long run. second, though many people assume that a major nuclear war would result in the extinction of the human race and of most species of mammals, that assumption is probably incorrect. undoubtedly the consequences of such a war would be horrible, but serious students of these matters do not believe that most species of mammals would be completely wiped out or that the human race would disappear. third, if nothing intervenes to prevent the technological system from proceeding to its logical conclusion, there is every reason to believe that the eventual result will be a planet uninhabitable for all of the more complex forms oflife as we know them today. see chapter two, part iv. so if we had to choose between a major nuclear war and the continued existence of the system, we would have to take nuclear war as the lesser evil. fourth, if we allow the defenders of the system to deter us with the threat of nuclear war or of any other dire consequences, then we may as well give up. a revolutionary movement can't be successful if it allows its pursuit of its objective to be limited by reservations or qualifications of any kind, for these can only lead to fatal hesitation at critical times. revolutionaries must take their goal to be the collapse of the system no matter what. you have to make a decision: is the elimination of the technological system worth all of the desperate risks and terrifying disasters that it will entail? if you don't have the courage to answer ""yes"" to that question, then you'd better quit whining about the evils and hardships of the modern world and just adapt yourself to them as best you can, because nothing short of the collapse of the system will ever get us off the road that we are on now. 14. in sections 12 and 13 we've offered some guidelines for revolutionary action to be taken upon the arrival of an acute crisis of the system. remaining to be discussed is the long preparatory period during which the movement builds its strength for the final push toward revolution. in a revolutionary situation-as we've pointed out already in section i-victory is determined not primarily by numbers but by the dynamics of social movements. in section 10 we've seen examples of numerically tiny movements that have initiated successful revolutions. a small but well-organized, unified, and deeply committed movement will have a far better chance of success than will a vastly larger movement that lacks these characteristics. in other words, quality is more important than quantity. consequently, while an organization is building its strength for a future revolution, it must strictly subordinate the goal of increasing its numbers to that of recruiting high-quality people who are capable of total commitment to the cause. their commitment must be exclusive; they must have no competing loyalty to any other cause. because the membership of the revolutionary organization has to be limited, as far as possible, to people of this type, selectiveness in recruitment is essential. 15. if the goal of revolutionaries is the complete elimination of the technological society, then they must discard the values and the morality of that society and replace them with new values and a new morality designed to serve the purposes of revolution. trotsky put it this way: bolshevism created the type of the authentic revolutionist who subordinates [his ideas and his moral judgments] to historic goals irreconcilable with contemporary society .. . . [t]he bolshevik party created not only a political but a moral medium of its own, independent of bourgeois social opinion and implacably opposed to it. only this permitted the bolsheviks to overcome the waverings in their own ranks and reveal in action that courageous determination without which the october [revolution] would have been impossible. suitable recruits to the revolutionary movement will include only those who are prepared to abandon the old values and morality and adopt in their place the revolutionary values and morality. the revolutionary message needs to be addressed to and designed for, not the general public, but the small minority of people who have the potential to become committed members of the revolutionary organization. 16. it follows that the revolutionaries should never retreat from their extreme positions for the sake of popularity or to avoid offending the moral or other sensibilities of the general public. if the revolutionary organization were to dilute its message or prevaricate in order to avoid offending people it would discourage its own members and lose their respect, weakening their commitment to the organization; it would lose the respect of the best kind of potential recruits while attracting many who were incapable of total commitment to the organization; and it would lose the respect of the general public. a revolutionary organization should seek not to be liked, but to be respected, and it should have no aversion to being hated and feared. mao regarded hatred of a revolutionary organization as a sign that it was effective. it is to such an organization that many people will turn in a time of crisis when they have lost all confidence in the existing social order and are desperate or angry. 17. revolutionaries will not suddenly become effective agitators, propagandists, organizers and leaders at the moment when the system reaches a crisis. they will need to begin developing these abilities through practical experience long before the crisis arrives. in order to acquire such experience, revolutionaries will have to involve themselves in political efforts that are peripheral to the central issue of technology. for example, an anti-tech organization might join other groups in addressing some environmental issue of special importance-though it will be necessary for the revolutionaries to make very clear that the environmental issue is a sideshow and that the long-term goal must be to eliminate the entire technological system. in all such activities the revolutionary organization should strive to prove itself more determined and more effective than the other groups involved, for when a crisis arrives the organization will more readily acquire a mass following if it has already demonstrated its superior effectiveness. ""[i]n the course of struggle . . . broad masses must learn from experience that we fight better than the others, that we see more clearly than the others, that we are more audacious and resolute."" a paper is not",26.32

no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward homosexuals, disabled people, fat people, old people, ugly people, and on and on and on. it’s not enough that the public should be informed about the hazards of smoking; a warning has to be stamped on every package of cigarettes. then cigarette advertising has to be restricted if not banned. the activists will never be satisfied until tobacco is outlawed, and after that it will be alcohol, then junk food, etc. activists have fought gross child abuse, which is reasonable. but now they want to stop all spanking. when they have done that they will want to ban something else they consider unwholesome, then another thing and then another. they will never be satisfied until they have complete control over all child rearing practices. and then they will move on to another cause. suppose you asked leftists to make a list of all the things that were wrong with society, and then suppose you instituted every social change that they demanded. it is safe to say that within a couple of years the majority of leftists would find something new to complain about, some new social “evil” to correct because, once again, the leftist is motivated less by distress at society’s ills than by the need to satisfy his drive for power by imposing his solutions on society. because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior by their high level of socialization, many leftists of the over-socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do. for them the drive for power has only one morally acceptable outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on everyone. leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are true believers in the sense of eric hoffer’s book, “the true believer.” but not all true believers are of the same psychological type as leftists. presumably a true-believing nazi, for instance, is very different psychologically from a true-believing leftist. because of their capacity for single-minded devotion to a cause, true believers are a useful, perhaps a necessary, ingredient of any revolutionary movement. this presents a problem with which we must admit we don’t know how to deal. we aren’t sure how to harness the energies of the true believer to a revolution against technology. at present all we can say is that no true believer will make a safe recruit to the revolution unless his commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology. if he is committed also to another ideal, he may want to use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal (see paragraphs 220, 221). some readers may say, “this stuff about leftism is a lot of crap. i know john and jane who are leftish types and they don’t have all these totalitarian tendencies.” it’s quite true that many leftists, possibly even a numerical majority, are decent people who sincerely believe in tolerating others’ values (up to a point) and wouldn’t want to use high-handed methods to reach their social goals. our remarks about leftism are not meant to apply to every individual leftist but to describe the general character of leftism as a movement. and the general character of a movement is not necessarily determined by the numerical proportions of the various kinds of people involved in the movement. the people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements tend to be leftists of the most power-hungry type, because power-hungry people are those who strive hardest to get into positions of power. once the power-hungry types have captured control of the movement, there are many leftists of a gentler breed who inwardly disapprove of many of the actions of the leaders, but cannot bring themselves to oppose them. they need their faith in the movement, and because they cannot give up this faith they go along with the leaders. true, some leftists do have the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that emerge, but they generally lose, because the power-hungry types are better organized, are more ruthless and machiavellian and have taken care to build themselves a strong power base. these phenomena appeared clearly in russia and other countries that were taken over by leftists. similarly, before the breakdown of communism in the, ussr, leftish types in the west would, seldom criticize that country. if prodded they would admit that the ussr did many wrong things, but then they would try to find excuses for the communists and begin talking about the faults of the west. they always opposed western military resistance to communist aggression. leftish types all over the world vigorously protested the u.s. military action in vietnam, but when the ussr invaded afghanistan they did nothing. not that they approved of the soviet actions; but because of their leftist faith, they just couldn’t bear to put themselves in opposition to communism. today, in those of our universities where “political correctness” has become dominant, there are probably many leftish types who privately disapprove of the suppression of academic freedom, but they go along with it anyway. thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a whole form having a totalitarian tendency. our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. it is still far from clear what we mean by the word “leftist.” there doesn’t seem to be much we can do about this. today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of activist movements. yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements (e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with leftists. varieties of leftists fade out gradually into varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed to decide whether a given individual is or is not a leftist. to the extent that it is defined at all, our conception of leftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article, and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in deciding who is a leftist. but it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism. these criteria cannot be applied in a cut and dried manner. some individuals may meet some of the criteria without being leftists, some leftists may not meet any of the criteria. again, you just have to use your judgment. the leftist is oriented toward large-scale collectivism. he emphasizes the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. he has a negative attitude toward individualism. he often takes a moralistic tone. he tends to be for gun control, for sex education and other psychologically “enlightened” educational methods, for social planning, for affirmative action, for multi- culturalism. he tends to identify with victims. he tends to be against competition and against violence, but he often finds excuses for those leftists who do commit violence. he is fond of using the common catch-phrases of the left, like “racism,” “sexism,” “homophobia,” “capitalism,” “imperialism,” “neocolonialism,” “genocide,” “social change,” “social justice,” “social responsibility.” maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his tendency to sympathize with the following movements: feminism, gay rights, ethnic rights, disability rights, animal rights, political correctness. anyone who strongly sympathizes with all of these movements is almost certainly a leftist. the more dangerous leftists, that is, those who are most power-hungry, are often characterized by arrogance or by a dogmatic approach to ideology. however, the most dangerous leftists of all may be certain oversocialized types who avoid irritating displays of aggressiveness and refrain from advertising their leftism, but work quietly and unobtrusively to promote collectivist values, “enlightened” psychological techniques for socializing children, dependence of the individual on the system, and so forth. these crypto-leftists (as we may call them) approximate certain bourgeois types as far as practical action is concerned, but differ from them in psychology, ideology and motivation. the ordinary bourgeois tries to bring people under control of the system in order to protect his way of life, or he does so simply because his attitudes are conventional. the crypto-leftist tries to bring people under control of the system because he is a true believer in a collectivist ideology. the crypto-leftist is differentiated from the average leftist of the oversocialized type by the fact that his rebellious impulse is weaker and he is more securely socialized. he is differentiated from the ordinary well-socialized bourgeois by the fact that there is some deep lack within him that makes it necessary for him to devote himself to a cause and immerse himself in a collectivity. and maybe his (well-sublimated) drive for power is stronger than that of the average bourgeois. throughout this article we’ve made imprecise statements and statements that ought",23.08

thus there are innumerable intersecting forces, an infinite collection of parallelograms of forces, and from them emerges a resultant-the historical event-which from another point of view can be regarded as the product of one power that, as a whole, operates unconsciously and without volition. for what each individual wants runs up against the opposition of every other, and what comes out of it all is something that no one wanted. norbert elias, who was not a marxist, made a very similar remark: [f]rom the interweaving of countless individual interests and intentions-whether tending in the same direction or in divergent and hostile directions-something comes into being that was planned and intended by none of these individuals, yet has emerged nevertheless from their intentions and actions. even in those rare cases in which almost everyone agrees on a policy, effective implementation of the policy may be prevented by what is called the ""problem of the commons."" the problem of the commons consists in the fact that it may be to everyone's advantage that everyone should act in a certain way, yet it may be to the advantage of each individual to act in a contrary way. for example, in modern society it is to everyone's advantage that everyone should pay a portion of his income to support the functions of government. yet it is to the advantage of each individual to keep all his income for himself, and that's why hardly anyone pays taxes voluntarily, or pays more than he has to. the answer to the foregoing arguments will be that political institutions exist precisely in order to resolve such problems: the concrete decisions made in the process of governing a society are not the resultant of conflicts among the innumerable individual wills of the population at large; instead, a small number of political leaders are formally empowered (through elections or otherwise) to make necessary decisions for everyone, and to enact laws that compensate for the problem of the commons by compelling individuals to do what is required for the common welfare (for example, laws that compel payment of taxes). since the top political leaders are relatively few in number, it is not unreasonable to hope that they can resolve their differences well enough to steer the development of a society rationally. actually, experience shows that when the top political leaders number more than, say, half a dozen or so, it must seriously be doubted whether they can ever resolve their differences well enough to be able to govern in a consistently rational way. but even where no conflicts exist among the top leaders, the real power of such leaders is very much less than the power that is formally assigned to them. consequently, their ability to steer the development of their society rationally is extremely limited at best. when this writer was in the sacramento county main jail in 1996-98, he had some interesting conversations with the jail administrator, lieutenant dan lewis. in the course of one such conversation, on december 31, 1996, lewis complained that it was not easy to get some of his officers to follow his orders, and he described the problems that a person in a position of formal power faces when he tries to exert that power to make his organization do what he wants it to do. if the leader takes measures that are resented by too many of the people under his command, he will meet with so much resistance that his organization will be paralyzed. it's not only jail administrators whose power is far more limited than it appears to an outsider. julius caesar reportedly said, ""the higher our station, the less is our freedom of action."" according to an english author of the 17th century: ""men in great place (saith one) are thrice servants; servants of the sovereign, or state; servants of fame; and servants of business. so as they have no freedom, neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times."" u.s. president abraham lincoln wrote: ""i claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."" while f.w. de klerk was president of south africa, nelson mandela asked him why he did not prevent acts of violence that in some cases were being carried out with the collusion of the police. de klerk replied, ""mr. mandela, when you join me [as a member of the government] you will realise i do not have the power which you think i have.""51 it's possible that de klerk was pleading powerlessness as an excuse for tolerating violence that in reality he might have been able to prevent. nevertheless, when mandela himself became president, he ""quickly realized, as de klerk had warned him, that a president had less power than he appeared to. he could rule effectively only through his colleagues and civil servants, who had to be patiently persuaded ... . "" in line with this, a thorough student of the american presidency, clinton rossiter, has explained how severely the power of the president of the united states is limited, not only by public opinion and by the power of congress, but also by conflicts with members of his own administration who, in theory, are totally under his command. rossiter refers to ""the trials undergone by [presidents] truman and eisenhower in persuading certain chiefs of staff, whose official lives depend entirely on the president's pleasure, to shape their acts and speeches to the policies of the administration."" one of our most powerful presidents, franklin d. roosevelt, complained: the treasury is so large and far-flung and ingrained in its practices that i find it is almost impossible to get the actions and results i want ... . but the treasury is not to be compared with the state department. you should go through the experience of trying to get any changes in the thinking, policy and action of the career diplomats and then you'd know what a real problem was. but the treasury and the state department put together are nothing compared with the na-a-vy. the admirals are really something to cope with-and i should know. to change anything in the na-a-vy is like punching a feather bed. you punch it with your right and you punch it with your left until you are finally exhausted, and then you find the damn bed just as it was before you started punching. roosevelt's capable successor in the presidency, harry s. truman, said: [p]eople talk about the powers of a president, all the powers that a chief executive has, and what he can do. let me tell you something-from experience! the president may have a great many powers given to him by the constitution and may have certain powers under certain laws which are given to him by the congress of the united states; but the principal power that the president has is to bring people in and try to persuade them to do what they ought to do without persuasion. that's what i spend most of my time doing. that's what the powers of the president amount to. thus, concentration of formal power in the hands of a few top leaders by no means liberates decision-making from engels's ""conflicts among many individual wills."" some people may be surprised to learn that this is true even in a society governed by a single, theoretically absolute ruler. from 200 bc to 1911 ad, all chinese dynasties were headed by an emperor who ""was the state's sole legislator, ultimate executive authority, and highest judge. his pronouncements were, quite literally, the law, and he alone was not bound by his own laws."" the emperor was supposed to be restrained by ""confucian norms and the values perpetuated by the scholar-official elite,"" but in the absence of an explicit codification or any mechanism for enforcement, these restraints were effective against the emperor only to the extent that some of his subjects were brave enough to challenge him on their own initiative, though the emperor, ""if he insisted, would prevail."" more important, therefore, were the practical limitations to which the emperor was subject. ""as the head of a vast governmental apparatus .. . he was . . . forced to delegate his powers to others who conducted the routine operations",26.8

(there may be disagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job is “minimal”; but usually, in lower- to middle-level jobs, whatever effort is required is merely that of obedience. you sit or stand where you are told to sit or stand and do what you are told to do in the way you are told to do it. seldom do you have to exert yourself seriously, and in any case you have hardly any autonomy in work, so that the need for the power process is not well served.) social needs, such as sex, love and status, often remain in group 2 in modern society, depending on the situation of the individual. but, except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status, the effort required to fulfill the social drives is insufficient to satisfy adequately the need for the power process. so certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group 2, hence serve the need for the power process. advertising and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel they need things that their grandparents never desired or even dreamed of. it requires serious effort to earn enough money to satisfy these artificial needs, hence they fall into group 2. (but see paragraphs 80-82.) modern man must satisfy his need for the power process largely through pursuit of the artificial needs created by the advertising and marketing industry , and through surrogate activities. it seems that for many people, maybe the majority, these artificial forms of the power process are insufficient. a theme that appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the 20th century is the sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society. (this purposelessness is often called by other names such as “anomie” or “middleclass vacuity.”) we suggest that the so-called “identity crisis” is actually a search for a sense of purpose, often for commitment to a suitable surrogate activity. it may be that existentialism is in large part a response to the purposelessness of modern life. very widespread in modern society is the search for “fulfillment.” but we think that for the majority of people an activity whose main goal is fulfillment (that is, a surrogate activity) does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment. in other words, it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process. (see paragraph 41.) that need can be fully satisfied only through activities that have some external goal, such as physical necessities, sex, love, status, revenge, etc. moreover, where goals are pursued through earning money, climbing the status ladder or functioning as part of the system in some other way, most people are not in a position to pursue their goals autonomously. most workers are someone else’s employee and, as we pointed out in paragraph 61, must spend their days doing what they are told to do in the way they are told to do it. even people who are in business for themselves have only limited autonomy. it is a chronic complaint of small-business persons and entrepreneurs that their hands are tied by excessive government regulation. some of these regulations are doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our extremely complex society. a large portion of small business today operates on the franchise system. it was reported in the wall street journal a few years ago that many of the franchise-granting companies require applicants for franchises to take a personality test that is designed to exclude those who have creativity and initiative, because such persons are not sufficiently docile to go along obediently with the franchise system. this excludes from small business many of the people who most need autonomy. today people live more by virtue of what the system does for them or to them than by virtue of what they do for themselves. and what they do for themselves is done more and more along channels laid down by the system. opportunities tend to be those that the system provides, the opportunities must be exploited in accord with rules and regulations , and techniques prescribed by experts must be followed if there is to be a chance of success. thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of real goals and a deficiency of autonomy in the pursuit of goals. but it is also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group 3: the drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one makes. one of these drives is the need for security. our lives depend on decisions made by other people; we have no control over these decisions and usually we do not even know the people who make them. (“we live in a world in which relatively few people -- maybe 500 or 1,000 make the important decisions” -- philip b. heymann of harvard law school, quoted by anthony lewis, new york times, april 21,1995.) our lives depend on whether safety standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained; on how much pesticide is allowed to get into our food or how much pollution into our air; on how skillful (or incompetent) our doctor is; whether we lose or get",25.42

maybe, but maybe not. in the first place, revolutionaries will not be able to break the system down unless it is already in enough trouble so that there would be a good chance of its eventually breaking down by itself any way; and the bigger the system grows, the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will be; so it may be that revolutionaries, by hastening the onset of the breakdown, will be reducing the extent of the disaster. 168. in the second place, one has to balance struggle and death against the loss of freedom and dignity. to many of us, freedom and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain. besides, we all have to die sometime, and it may be better to die fighting for survival, or for a cause, than to live a long but empty and purposeless life. 169. in the third place, it is not at all certain that survival of the system will lead to less suffering than the breakdown of the system would. the system has already caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffering all over the world. ancient cultures, that for hundreds or thousands of years gave people a satisfactory relationship with each other and with their environment, have been shattered by contact with industrial society, and the result has been a whole catalog of economic, environmental, social and psychological problems. one of the eff ects of the intrusion of industrial society has been that overmuch of the world traditional controls on population have been thrown out of balance. hence the population explosion, with all that that implies. then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread throughout the supposedly fortunate countries of the west (see paragraphs 44, 45). no one knows what will happen as a result of ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen. and, as nuclear proliferation has shown, new technology cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible third world nations. would you like to speculate about what iraq or north korea will do with genetic engineering? 170. ""oh!"" say the technophiles, ""science is going to fix all that! we will conquer famine, eliminate psychological suffering, make everybody healthy and happy!"" yeah, sure. that's what they said 200 years ago. hie industrial revolution was supposed to eliminate poverty, make everybody happy, etc. the actual result has been quite different. the technophiles are hopelessly naive (or self-deceiving) in their understanding of social problems. they are unaware of (or choose to ignore) the fact that when large changes, even seemingly beneficial ones, are introduced into a society, they lead to a long sequence of other changes, most of which are impossible to predict (paragraph 103). the result is disruption of the society. so it is very probable that in their attempts to end poverty and disease, engineer docile, happy personalities and so forth, the technophiles will create social systems that are terribly troubled, even more so than the present one. for example, the scientists boast that they will end famine by creating new, genetically engineered food plants. but this will allow the human population to keep expanding indefinitely, and it is well known that crowding leads to increased stress and aggression. this is merely one example of the predictable problems that will arise. we emphasize that, as past experience has shown, technical progress will lead to other new problems that cannot be predicted in advance (paragraph 103). in fact, ever since the industrial revolution technology has been creating new problems for society far more rapidly that it has been solving old ones. thus it will take a long and difficult period of trial and error for the technophiles to work the bugs out of their brave new world (if they ever do). in the mean time there will be great suff ering. so it is not at all clear that the survival of industrial society would involve less suffering than the breakdown of that society would. technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is not likely to be any easy escape. 171. but suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decades and that the bugs do eventually get worked out of the system, so that it functions smoothly. what kind of system will it be? we will consider several possibilities. 172. first let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings can do them. in that case presumably all work will be done by vast, highly organized systems of",22.39

white activists who work for the rights of non white minorities. these are not always pure surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. but for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. for example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the ""fulfillment"" they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn. 41. for many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals ( that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). one indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. the scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. the long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do f rom the ""mundane""business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the eff ort required to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. more importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs autonomously but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. in contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities. 42. autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. but most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. it is usually enough to act as a member of a small group. thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. but if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need for the power process will not be served. the same is true when decisions are made on a collective basis if the group making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. 43. it is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. and then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfi ed with a purely physical sense of power (the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors). 44. but for most people it is through the power process — having a goal, making an autonomous effort and attaining the goal — that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. when one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders, etc. 45. any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale. we aren't the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. this sort of thing is not normal for human societies. there is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. it is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. abuse of women was common among the australian aborigines, transsexuality was fairly common among some of the american indian tribes. but is does appear that generally speaking the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society. 46. we attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. it is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. but it is not the only one. before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources. 47. among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe. 48. it is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. the degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress. all preindustrial societies were predominantly rural. the industrial revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people's hands. for example, a variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. if the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. if their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. but if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.) 49. for primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable f ramework and therefore a sense of security. in the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. thus there is no stable framework. 50. the conservatives are fools: they whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. apparently it never occurs to them that you can't make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values. 51. the breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. the disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. beyond that, a technological society has to weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. in modern society an individual's loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a small-scale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system. 52. suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin, his friend or his coreligionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job. he has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is ""nepotism"" or ""discrimination,"" both of which are terrible sins in modern society. would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (look at latin america.) thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are emasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. 53. crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of social problems. but we do not believe they are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today. 54. a few preindustrial cities were very large and crowded, yet",23.44

(we see this happening already. there are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work, because for intellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves useful in the present system.) on those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: they will need more and more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, conforming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism. their tasks will be increasingly specialized, so that their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world, being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality. the system will have to use any means that it can, whether psychological or biological, to engineer people to be docile, to have the abilities that the system requires and to “sublimate” their drive for power into some specialized task. but the statement that the people of such a society will have to be docile may require qualification. the society may find competitiveness useful, provided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that serve the needs of the system. we can imagine a future society in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige and power. but no more than a very few people will ever reach the top, where the only real power is (see end of paragraph 163). very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his need for power only by pushing large numbers of other people out of the way and depriving them of their opportunity for power. one can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the possibilities that we have just discussed. for instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. it has been suggested, for example, that a great development of the service industries might provide work for human beings. thus people would spent their time shining each other’s shoes, driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other’s tables, etc. this seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work. they would seek other, dangerous outlets (drugs, crime, “cults,” hate groups) unless they were biologically or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such a way of life. needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. they only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. but we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we’ve just described. it is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: individuals (at least those of the “bourgeois” type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more “socialized” than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of god’s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). in the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed. whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating for human beings a new physical and social environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural selection has adapted the human race physically and psychologically. if man is not adjusted to this new environment by being artificially re-engineered, then he will be adapted to it through a long and painful process of natural selection. the former is far more likely than the latter. it would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences. the technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable. but we (fc) don’t think it is inevitable. we think it can be stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it. as we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system. when the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may be possible. the pattern would be similar to that of the french and russian revolutions. french society and russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one. in the russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order. then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress (by financial crisis in france, by military defeat in russia) it was swept away by revolution. what we propose is something along the same lines. it will be objected that the french and russian revolutions were failures. but most revolutions have two goals. one is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries. the french and russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite successful in destroying the old society. we have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. our goal is only to destroy the existing form of society. but an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have a positive ideal as well as a negative one; it must be for something as well as against something. the positive ideal that we propose is nature. that is, wild nature: those aspects of the functioning of the earth and its living things that are independent of human management and free of human interference and control. and with wild nature we include human nature, by which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of chance, or free will, or god (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions). nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. nature (that which is outside the power of the system) is the opposite of technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the system). most people will agree that nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. the radical environmentalists already hold an ideology that exalts nature",24.59

""green"" energy sources aren't going to wean the system from its dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power. but even if they did, green energy sources don't look so green when one examines them closely. ""there's no free lunch when it comes to meeting our energy needs,"" says the director of the natural resources defense council's land program. ""to get energy, we need to do things that will have impacts."" the construction of wind farms entails the creation of radioactive waste because, as noted earlier, the lightweight permanent magnets in wind turbines require the rare-earth element neodymium. in addition, wind farms kill numerous birds, which fly into the ""propellers"" of the turbines. large numbers of new wind-farms are planned in the u. s., china, and presumably other countries as well, and a likely result will be the extermination of many species of birds.

"" according to janine blaeloch, executive director of the western lands project, ""these [solar energy] plants will introduce a huge amount of damage to our public land and habitat."" and remember, the system's appetite for energy is insatiable: in all probability, the development of solar energy will expand until there is no habitat left for living organisms other than the domesticated crops that the system grows to satisfy its own needs. but there is much more to be taken into account. notwithstanding the folly of ray kurzweil's fantasies of a future technological utopia, he is absolutely right about some things. he quite correctly points out that in thinking about the future most people make two errors: (i) they ""consider the transformations that will result from a single trend [or from several specified trends that are already evident] in today's world as if nothing else will change."" and (ii) they ""intuitively assume that the current rate of progress will continue for future periods,"" neglecting the unending acceleration of technological development. in order to avoid falling into these errors ourselves, we have to remember that the assaults on the terrestrial environment that are known and observable now will not in future be the only ones. just as the use of petroleum distillates in internal combustion engines was undreamed of before 1860 at the earliest, just as the use of uranium as fuel was undreamed of before the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938-39, just as most uses of the rare earths were undreamed of until recent decades, so there will be future uses of resources, future ways of exploiting the environment, future corners for the technological system to invade that at present are still undreamed of. in attempting to estimate the coming damage to our environment, we can't just project into the future the effects of currently known causes of environmental harm; we have to assume that new causes of environmental harm, which no one today can even imagine, will emerge in the future. moreover, we have to remember that the growth of technology, and with it the exacerbation of the harm that technology does to our environment, will accelerate ever more rapidly over the coming decades. all this being taken into consideration we have to conclude that, in all probability, little or nothing on our planet will much longer remain free of gross disruption by the technological system. most people take our atmosphere for granted, as if providence had decreed once and for all that air should consist of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1 % other gasses. in reality our atmosphere in its present form was created, and is still maintained, through the action of living things. originally the atmosphere contained far more carbon dioxide than it does today, and we may wonder why the greenhouse effect didn't make the earth too hot for life ever to begin. the answer, presumably, is that the sun at that time radiated much less energy than it does now. in any case, it was the biosphere that took the excess carbon dioxide out of the air: as primitive bacteria and cyanobacteria had, through photosynthesis or related life processes, captured atmospheric carbon, depositing it on the seafloor, carbon was removed from the atmosphere . . . . cyanobacteria also were the first organisms to utilize water as a source of electrons and hydrogen in the photosynthetic process. free oxygen was released as a result of this reaction and began to accumulate in the atmosphere, allowing oxygen-dependent life-forms to evolve. biological processes also affect the amount of methane in the atmosphere, and let's remember that methane has a far more powerful effect in promoting global warming than carbon dioxide does. on the other hand, some experts claim that 3.7 billion years ago certain microbes generated large quantities of methane that, instead of warming the planet, cooled it by creating clouds that reflected sunlight back into space. supposedly, the earth narrowly escaped becoming too cold for the survival of life. however that may be, it's evident that a really radical disruption of the biosphere could cause an atmospheric disaster: a lack of oxygen, a concentration of toxic gasses such as methane or ammonia, a deficiency or an excess of carbon dioxide that would make our planet too cold or too hot to support life. at present, the most imminent danger seems to be the possible overheating of the earth through an excess in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and perhaps methane. just how hot might the earth get if humans continue to burn fossil fuels? about 56 million years ago there was a massive increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, estimated to be roughly equal to the amount that would be added now if humans burned off ""all the earth's reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas."" the result was a radical change in the terrestrial environment, including a 9° f (5° c) rise in average temperatures and the flooding of substantial parts of the continents. there weren't any mass extinctions, but this should give us no sense of security about the future of the biosphere, because we can't assume that the effect of adding a given amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere today will be the same as what it was 56 million years ago. the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere 56 million years ago was probably added relatively slowly, over thousands of years. if humans now burn off all",23.47

(there may be disagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job is ""minimal""; but usually, in lower- to middle-level jobs, whatever effort is required is merely that of obedience. you sit or stand where you are told to sit or stand and do what you are told to do in the way you are told to do it. seldom do you have to exert yourself seriously, and in any case you have hardly any autonomy in work, so that the need for the power process is not well served.) 62. social needs, such as sex, love and status, often remain in group 2 in modern society, depending on the situation of the individual. but, except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status, the eff ort required to fulfill the social drives is insufficient to satisfy adequately the need for the power process. 63. so certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group 2, hence serve the need for the power process. advertising and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel they need things that their grandparents never desired or even dreamed of. it requires serious effort to earn enough money to satisfy these artificial needs, hence they fall into group 2. (but see paragraphs 80-82.) modern man must satisfy his need for the power process largely through pursuit of the artificial needs created by the advertising and marketing industry, and through surrogate activities. 64. it seems that for many people, maybe the majority, these artificial forms of the power process are insufficient. a theme that appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the 20th century is the sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society. (this purposelessness is often called by other names such as ""anomie"" or ""middle-class vacuity"") we suggest that the so-called ""identity crisis"" is actually a search for a sense of purpose, often for commitment to a suitable surrogate activity. it may be that existentialism is in large part a response to the purposelessness of modern life . very widespread in modern society is the search for ""fulfillment."" but we think that for the majority of people an activity whose main goal is fulfillment (that is, a surrogate activity) does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment. in other words, it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process. (see paragraph 41.) lhat need can be fully satisfied only through activities that have some external goal, such as physical necessities, sex, love, status, revenge, etc. 65. moreover, where goals are pursued through earning money, climbing the status ladder or functioning as part of the system in some other way, most people are not in a position to pursue their goals autonomously. most workers are someone else's employee and, as we pointed out in paragraph 61, must spend their days doing what they are told to do in the way they are told to do it. even most people who are in business for themselves have only limited autonomy. it is a chronic complaint of small-business persons and entrepreneurs that their hands are tied by excessive government regulation. some of these regulations are doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our extremely complex society. a large portion of small business today operates on the franchise system. it was reported in the wall street journal a few years ago that many of the franchise-granting companies require applicants for franchises to take a personality test that is designed to exclude those who have creativity and initiative, because such persons are not sufficiently docile to go along obediently with the franchise system. this excludes from small business many of the people who most need autonomy. 66. today pe»ple live more by virtue of what the system does for them or to them than by virtue of what they do for themselves. and what they do for themselves is done more and more along channels laid down by the system. opportunities tend to be those that the system provides, the opportunities must be exploited in accord with the rules and regulations, and techniques prescribed by experts must be followed if there is to be a chance of success. 67. thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of real goals and a defi ciency of autonomy in the pursuit of goals. but it is also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group 3: the drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much eff ort one makes. one of these drives is the need for security. our lives depend on decisions made by other people; we have no control over these decisions and usually we do not even know the people who make them.

(see paragraph 127.) propaganda for example is used for many good purposes, such as discouraging child abuse or race hatred. sex education is obviously useful, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent that it is successf ul) is to take the shaping of sexual attitudes away from the family and put it into the hands of the state as represented by the public school system. 154. suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the likelihood that a child will grow up to be a criminal, and suppose some sort of gene therapy can remove this trait. of course most parents whose children possess the trait will have them undergo the therapy. it would be inhumane to do otherwise, since the child would probably have a miserable life if he grew up to be a criminal. but many or most primitive societies have a low crime rate in comparison with that of our society, even though they have neither high-tech methods of child-rearing nor harsh systems of punishment. since there is no reason to suppose that more modern men than primitive men have innate predatory tendencies, the high crime rate of our society must be due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people, to which many cannot or will not adjust. thus a treatment designed to remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of re-engineering people so that they suit the requirements of the system. 155. our society tends to regard as a ""sickness"" any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system, and this is plausible, because when an individual doesn't fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system. thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the system is seen as a ""cure"" for a ""sickness"" and therefore as good. 156. in paragraph 127 we pointed out that if the use of a new item of technology is initially optional, it does not necessarily remain optional, because the new technology tends to change society in such a way that it becomes difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that technology. this applies also to the technology of human behavior. in a world in which most children are put through a program to make them enthusiastic about studying, a parent will almost be forced to put his kid through such a program, because if he does not, then the kid will grow up to be, comparatively speaking, an ignoramus and therefore unemployable. or suppose a biological treatment is discovered that, without undesirable side-effects, will greatly reduce the psychological stress f rom which so many people suffer in our society. if large numbers of people choose to undergo the treatment, then the general level of stress in society will be reduced, so that it will be possible for the system to increase the stress-producing pressures. this will lead more people to undergo the treatment; and so forth, so that eventually the pressures may become so heavy that few people will be able to survive without undergoing the stress-reducing treatment. in fact, something like this seems to have happened already with one of our society's most important psychological tools for enabling people to reduce (or at least temporarily escape from) stress, namely, mass entertainment (see paragraph 147). our use of mass entertainment is ""optional"": no law requires us to watch television, listen to the radio, read magazines. yet mass entertainment is a means of escape and stress-reduction on which most of us have become dependent. everyone complains about the trashiness of television, but almost everyone watches it. a few have kicked the tv habit, but it would be a rare person who could get along today without using any form of mass entertainment. (yet until quite recently in human history most people got along very nicely with no other entertainment than that which each local community created for itself .) without the entertainment industry the system probably would not have been able to get away with putting as much stress-producing pressure on us as it does. 157. assuming that industrial society survives, it is likely that technology will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behavior. it has been established beyond any rational doubt that human thought and behavior have a largely biological basis. as experimenters have demonstrated, feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the brain. memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can be brought to the surface by electrical stimulation. hallucinations can be induced or moods changed by drugs. there may or may not be an immaterial human soul, but if there is one it clearly is less powerful than the biological mechanisms of human behavior. for if that were not the case then researchers would not be able so easily to manipulate human feelings and behavior with drugs and electrical currents. 158. it presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes inserted in their heads so that they could be controlled by the authorities. but the fact that human thoughts and feelings are so open to biological intervention shows that the problem of controlling human behavior is mainly a technical problem; a problem of neurons, hormones and complex molecules; the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific attack. given the outstanding record of our society in solving technical problems, it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances will be made in the control of human behavior. 159. will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of human behavior? it certainly would if an attempt were made to introduce such control all at once. but since technological control will be introduced through a long sequence of small advances, there will be no rational and effective public resistance. (see paragraphs 127,132, 153.) 160. to those who think that all this sounds like science fiction, we point out that yesterday's science fiction is today's fact. the industrial revolution has radically altered man's environment and way of lif e, and it is only to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been. 161. but we have gotten ahead of our story. it is one thing to develop in the laboratory a series of psychological or biological techniques for manipulating human behavior and quite another to integrate these techniques into a functioning social system. the latter problem is the more difficult of the two. for example, while the techniques of educational psychology doubtless work quite well in the ""lab schools"" where they are developed, it is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout our educational system. we all know what many of our schools are like. the teachers are too busy taking knives and guns away from the kids to subject them to the latest techniques for making them into computer nerds. thus, in spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior, the system to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings. the people whose behavior is fairly well under the control of the system are those of the type that might be called ""bourgeois."" but there are growing numbers of people who in one way or another are rebels against the system: welfare leeches, youth gangs, cultists, satanists, nazis, radical environmentalists, militiamen, etc. 162. the system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival, among which the problems of human behavior are the most important. if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. otherwise it will break down. we think the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years. 163. suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades. by that time it will have to have solved, or at least brought under control, the principal problems that confront it, in particular that of ""socializing"" human beings; that is, making people sufficiently docile so that their behavior no longer threatens the system, lhat being accomplished, it does not appear that there would be any further obstacle to the development of technology, and it would presumably advance toward its logical conclusion, which is complete control over everything on earth, including human beings and all other important organisms. the system may become",25.86

(one recalls the lines of samuel butler: ''all great fleas have little fleas to bite 'em, and these have smaller still, and so ad infinitum."") needless to say, there do exist limits to the conditions under which life can survive. e .g., it has been questioned whether there can ever be a ""general mechanism by which any conventional protein could be made stable and functional at temperatures above 100° c."" yet some organisms do live at temperatures as high as 113° c., though none is known to survive and reproduce at a higher temperature. like biological organisms, the world's leading human self-prop systems exploit every opportunity, utilize every resource, and invade every corner where they can find anything that will be of use to them in their endless search for power. and as technology advances, more and more of what formerly seemed useless turns out to be useful after all, so that more and more resources are extracted, more and more corners are invaded, and more and more destructive consequences follow. for example: when humans made no use of metals other than iron meteorites, or nuggets of gold or copper that might be found by chance, the only mining activity consisted in the digging-out of rocks such as flint or obsidian that were used to make tools. but once people learned to utilize metals on a large scale the destructive effects of mining became evident. certainly by the 16th century, and probably much earlier, it was clearly recognized that mining poisoned streams and rivers and ruined the countryside where it occurred. but in those days mining affected only a few districts where there were known deposits of relatively high-grade ore, and people who lived elsewhere probably never gave a thought to the damage caused by the extraction of metals. in recent times, however, more sophisticated means of detecting deposits of valuable minerals have been devised, as well as methods for utilizing low-grade ores that formerly were left undisturbed because the extraction of metal from them was too difficult to be profitable. as a result of these developments mining activities have continually invaded new areas, and severe environmental damage has followed. it is said that the water flowing out of many old mining sites is so heavily contaminated that it will have to be treated ""forever"" to remove the toxic metals. of course, it won't be treated forever, and when the treatment stops, rivers will be irremediably poisoned. mining activities are invading still other areas because new uses have been found for elements that several decades ago had few if any practical applications. most of the ""rare earth"" elements were oflimited utility before the middle of the 20th century, but they are now considered indispensable for many purposes. the rare earth neodymium, for example, is needed in large quantities for the lightweight permanent magnets used in wind turbines. unfortunately, most deposits of rare earths contain radioactive thorium, hence the mining of these metals generates radioactive waste. in quantitative terms, at least, uranium was of little importance prior to the development of atomic weapons and nuclear power-plants; it is now mined on a large scale. relatively small amounts of arsenic were no doubt sufficient for medical applications and for the manufacture of rat poison and artists' pigments, but today the element is used in large quantities, e.g., to harden lead alloys and as a wood preservative. fence posts treated with cupric arsenate are extremely common in the western united states-there must be many millions of them. these posts last far longer than untreated ones, but they are not indestructible. they will eventually disintegrate, and when they do the arsenic they contain will spread through our environment. large-scale mining and utilization of other toxic and/ or carcinogenic elements such as mercury, lead, and cadmium are likewise spreading them everywhere. cleanup efforts are so puny in relation to the magnitude of the problem that they are little better than a joke. the extraction and processing of other resources have followed similar trajectories. petroleum, long known as a substance that seeped from the ground in places, originally had few uses. but during the 19th century it was discovered that kerosene, distilled from petroleum, could be burned for illumination in lamps, and for that purpose was superior to whale oil. as a result of this discovery the first ""oil well"" was drilled in pennsylvania in 1859, and drilling elsewhere soon followed. the petroleum industry at that time was based mainly on kerosene; there was little demand for other petroleum products, such as natural gas and gasoline. but natural gas later came to be used on a large scale for heating, cooking, and illumination, and after the advent of the gasoline-powered automobile around the beginning of the 20th century the petroleum industry won a position of central importance in the economy of the industrialized world. from that time on, new uses for petroleum products have continually been discovered. in addition, processes have been developed for transforming hydrocarbons so that formerly useless petroleum distillates can be turned into useful products, and oil deposits that, because of their undesirable characteristics (e.g., high sulfur content), might not have been worth extracting, can now be made valuable. oil companies have come up with ever more sophisticated methods for locating petroleum deposits, and this is one of the reasons why estimates of ""known oil reserves"" keep increasing. but the estimates also increase because previously inaccessible petroleum is made accessible by new technologies that make it profitable to extract petroleum (including natural gas) from ever more difficult sources. drillers penetrate deeper and deeper into the earth's crust, and are even able to drill horizontally; ""fracking"" (hydraulic fracturing) releases new reserves of oil, and especially gas, from shale rock; techniques are under development for utilizing the vast deposits of methane hydrate found on the ocean floor. as a result of all these technical advances more and more of the earth's surface is raped by the petroleum industry, and for humans who get in the way it's just tough luck. fracking, for example, is not a benign technique; at least one woman who was affected by it felt that her life had been ruined. anyone who thinks the technological world-system i s ever going to stop burning fossil fuels (while any are left) is dreaming. but whether or not the system ever renounces such fuels, other destructive sources of energy will be utilized. nuclear power-plants generate radioactive waste; no provably safe way of disposing of such waste has yet been indentified, and the world's leading self-prop systems aren't even trying very hard to find a permanent home for the accumulating radioactive garbage. of course, the self-prop systems need energy for the maintenance of their power here and now, whereas radioactive waste represents only a danger for the future and, as we've emphasized, natural",27.27

though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people. any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should be careful about what kind of conflict one encourages. the line of conflict should be drawn between the mass of the people and the power-holding elite of industrial society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business executives, government officials, etc.). it should not be drawn between the revolutionaries and the mass of the people. for example, it would be bad strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn americans for their habits of consumption. instead, the average american should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and marketing industry, which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he doesn’t need and that is very poor compensation for his lost freedom. either approach is consistent with the facts. it is merely a matter of attitude whether you blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for allowing itself to be manipulated. as a matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the public. one should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that between the power-holding elite (which wields technology) and the general public (over which technology exerts its power). for one thing, other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts (between power-elite and ordinary people, between technology and nature); for another thing, other conflicts may actually tend to encourage technologization, because each side in such a conflict wants to use technological power to gain advantages over its adversary. this is clearly seen in rivalries between nations. it also appears in ethnic conflicts within nations. for example, in america many black leaders are anxious to gain power for african americans by placing back individuals in the technological power-elite. they want there to be many black government officials, scientists, corporation executives and so forth. in this way they are helping to absorb the african american subculture into the technological system. generally speaking, one should encourage only those social conflicts that can be fitted into the framework of the conflicts of power-elite vs. ordinary people, technology vs. nature. but the way to discourage ethnic conflict is not through militant advocacy of minority rights (see paragraphs 21, 29). instead, the revolutionaries should emphasize that although minorities do suffer more or less disadvantage, this disadvantage is of peripheral significance. our real enemy is the industrial- technological system, and in the struggle against the system, ethnic distinctions are of no importance. the kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. it may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a political revolution. its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics. probably the revolutionaries should even avoid assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. suppose for example that some “green” party should win control of the united states congress in an election. in order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. to the average man the results would appear disastrous: there would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. dissatisfaction would grow, the “green” party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. for this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. the revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above. the revolution must be international and worldwide. it cannot be carried out on a nation-by-nation basis. whenever it is suggested that the united states, for example, should cut back on technological progress or economic growth, people get hysterical",23.08

(recall the remark of benjamin franklin quoted in part ii of chapter two, and see part c of appendix two, below.) the notion of a future society governed in accord with a mathematical control system, rationally chosen and designed, can be dismissed as science fiction. c. let's take another look at the idea that we considered and disposed of in part v of chapter one: that of an all-powerful philosopherking. in order even to entertain the notion that such a philosopher-king could rationally steer the development of a society, we already had to make assumptions that were wildly improbable. we then noted that, even granting those assumptions, we still ran into fundamental difficulties: that of selecting a satisfactory philosopher-king and putting him into a position of absolute power; and that of ensuring the succession, after the death of the original philosopher-king, of a long line of competent and conscientious philosopher-kings who would all govern in accord with some stable and permanent system of values. the technophiles will have a ready answer to the second difficulty: they will argue that biotechnology will make it possible in the future to hold back the aging process indefinitely; hence, our philosopher-king will be immortal and the question of choosing a successor will never arise. but this still doesn't solve the problem of rational guidance of a society's development, for people change over time, and our philosopher-king will change too. his decisions will affect the society in which he lives in ways that will not be fully predictable, and the changes in society will in turn affect the philosopher-king's goals and values in ways that cannot be foreseen. consequently, the society's development over the long term will not be steered in accord with any stable system of values but will drift unpredictably. at this point in our discussion-and only at this point-the distinction between human beings and intelligent machines becomes relevant: in place of a human philosopher-king, technophiles may propose rule by a supercomputer hardwired to adhere forever to a fixed system of values. even if we assume that such a computer could be created and that it would remain internally stable, we still face fundamental difficulties: who is going to decide what values are to be hardwired into the electronic philosopher-king, and how will they put their electronic philosopher-king into a position of absolute power? this is no more easy to answer than the question discussed in part v of chapter one of how to choose a human philosopher-king and put him into a position of absolute power, or the question discussed in part b of this appendix of how to choose a mathematical control system and secure the submission of society to its rule. it would in any event be impossible to formulate a satisfactory system of values. any values would be sure to give unsatisfactory results if they were sufficiently precise and rigid to determine the electronic philosopher-king's decisions in all cases without leaving the machine any substantial discretion to make its own value-judgments. this will be clear to anyone who has ever done much research in american constitutional law. the rules of decision laid down by the courts are full of vague ""balancing tests"" and indefinite ""factors"" on which judges are supposed to rely in deciding cases. two judges applying the same ""balancing test"" or ""factors"" in the same case will often come to radically different conclusions; hence the numerous dissenting opinions that one finds in the published decisions of the u.s. circuit courts and the supreme court. the reason why the rules of decision are so vague and flexible is that it is impossible to formulate precise, rigid principles that will determine the outcome of all cases in even a remotely satisfactory way. if the courts were held strictly to any such set of rigid principles, they would be forced to make many decisions that practically everyone would regard as unreasonable. on the other hand, if the system of values hardwired into the electronic philosopher-king were sufficiently vague or flexible to allow the machine any significant leeway to make its own value-judgments, gone would be the stability of values that the hardwiring was supposed to ensure. where principles are in any substantial degree vague or flexible, one can usually find a way to justify almost anything in terms of them. hence, two decisions that are both arguably in harmony with the same set of principles can have radically different practical consequences; this again is seen in the dissenting as against the majority opinions of the u. s. federal courts. thus, even apart from all other difficulties, the impossibility of formulating a satisfactory system of values is by itself sufficient to justify us in dismissing as science fiction the notion of a future society ruled by a supercomputer hardwired to govern according to a stable and permanent system of values, if the system of values is expected to give results that we would regard as even marginally acceptable. d. the reader may wonder why we have even bothered with this excursion into science fiction. but for the problems facing our society today it is likely that technophiles will envision future solutions that to most people will look like science fiction. ray kurzweil's book, for example, is full of that type of material, and much of it is indeed science fiction. nonetheless, it is always risky to dismiss ideas about future technological developments as science fiction solely because they seem implausible on vague intuitive grounds. things that seemed implausible at the outset of the industrial revolution, or even just a few decades ago, are not the least bit implausible today. to mention only one example, back in the 1950s, when moore's law had never been heard of, most people, probably including most computer scientists, would have dismissed as implausible the suggestion that fifty years later every tom, dick, and harry would hold comfortably in his lap more computing power than that of a whole roomful of 1950s computing machinery costing millions of dollars. futuristic proposals need to be examined critically and dismissed as science fiction only when good reasons for the dismissal have been found. but whatever technological miracles the future may have in store, we think there are excellent reasons for dismissing as science fiction the notion that the development of a society will ever be subject to rational guidance. appendix two in support of chapter two a. proposition 2 of chapter two states that in the short term, natural selection favors self-propagating systems that pursue their own short-term advantage with little or no regard for long-term consequences. steven le blanc1 argues that among primitive societies natural selection favors ecological recklessness. suppose one group lives prudently within its resources while a neighboring group allows its population to grow to the point where its resources are over-strained, so that its environment is damaged and it can no longer feed itself adequately. in order to find an outlet for its surplus population, the second group may try to take the first group's territory by force, and it is likely to succeed, because it has more people and can put more warriors into the field than the first group can. ""this smacks of a darwinian competition-survival of the fittest-between societies. note that the 'fittest' of our two groups was not the more ecological, it was the one that grew faster."" le blanc admits that his argument is oversimplified, and certainly it is not applicable in all circumstances, but it does seem to contain a good deal of truth. during the 1920s the soviets needed to acquire technological equipment from industrialized countries in order to catch up with the west economically, so they resorted to trade with western capitalists. one might have thought that capitalists would refuse to trade with communists, since the latter were bent on destroying capitalism, but in order to make a profit the capitalists were willing, as lenin allegedly put it, to ""sell the rope to their own hangmen."" in 1971, alinsky claimed to ""feel confident"" that he could ""persuade a millionaire on a friday to subsidize a revolution for saturday out of which he would make a huge profit on sunday even though he was certain to be executed on monday."" alinsky was exaggerating for humorous effect, but his remark does reflect a truth about capitalism. it's easy to attribute the capitalists' shortsightedness to ""greed,"" but there is a reason why capitalists are greedy: those who forgo profit in the present from concern for long-term consequences tend to be eliminated by natural selection. the u. s. financial crisis that began i n 2007 resulted from the widespread offering of risky (""subprime"") loans to borrowers who needed the money to buy homes but might never be able to pay it back. lenders such as savings-and-loan",31.25

(the leaders of the system say they want to strengthen the family, but they really mean is that they want the family to serve as an effective tool for socializing children in accord with the needs of the system. we argue in paragraphs 51, 52 that the system cannot afford to let the family or other small-scale social groups be strong or autonomous.) it may be argued that the majority of people don’t want to make their own decisions but want leaders to do their thinking for them. there is an element of truth in this. people like to make their own decisions in small matters, but making decisions on difficult, fundamental questions requires facing up to psychological conflict, and most people hate psychological conflict. hence they tend to lean on others in making difficult decisions. but it does not follow that they like to have decisions imposed upon them without having any opportunity to influence those decisions. the majority of people are natural followers, not leaders, but they like to have direct personal access to their leaders, they want to be able to influence the leaders and participate to some extent in making even the difficult decisions. at least to that degree they need autonomy. some of the symptoms listed are similar to those shown by caged animals. to explain how these symptoms arise from deprivation with respect to the power process: common-sense understanding of human nature tells one that lack of goals whose attainment requires effort leads to boredom and that boredom, long continued, often leads eventually to depression. failure to attain goals leads to frustration and lowering of self-esteem. frustration leads to anger, anger to aggression, often in the form of spouse or child abuse. it has been shown that long-continued frustration commonly leads to depression and that depression tends to cause guilt, sleep disorders, eating disorders and bad feelings about oneself. those who are tending toward depression seek pleasure as an antidote; hence insatiable hedonism and excessive sex, with perversions as a means of getting new kicks. boredom too tends to cause excessive pleasure-seeking since, lacking other goals, people often use pleasure as a goal. see accompanying diagram. the foregoing is a simplification. reality is more complex, and of course, deprivation with respect to the power process is not the only cause of the symptoms described. by the way, when we mention depression we do not necessarily mean depression that is severe enough to be treated by a psychiatrist. often only mild forms of depression are involved. and when we speak of goals we do not necessarily mean long-term, thought-out goals. for many or most people through much of human history, the goals of a hand-to-mouth existence (merely providing oneself and one’s family with food from day to day) have been quite sufficient. a partial exception may be made for a few passive, inward-looking groups, such as the amish, which have little effect on the wider society. apart from these, some genuine small-scale communities do exist in america today. for instance, youth gangs and “cults.” everyone regards them as dangerous, and so they are, because the members of these groups are loyal primarily to one another rather than to the system, hence the system cannot control them. or take the gypsies. the gypsies commonly get away with theft and fraud because their loyalties are such that they can always get other gypsies to give testimony that “proves” their innocence. obviously the system would be in serious trouble if too many people belonged to such groups. some of the early-20th century chinese thinkers who were concerned with modernizing china recognized the necessity breaking down small-scale social groups such as the family: “(according to sun yat-sen) the chinese people needed a new surge of patriotism, which would lead to a transfer of loyalty from the family to the state.... (according to li huang) traditional attachments, particularly to the family had to be abandoned if nationalism were to develop in china.” (chester c. tan, “chinese political thought in the twentieth century,” page 125, page 297.) yes, we know that 19th century america had its problems, and serious ones, but for the sake of brevity we have to express ourselves in simplified terms. we leave aside the “underclass.” we are speaking of the mainstream. some social scientists, educators, “mental health” professionals and the like are doing their best to push the social drives into group 1 by trying to see to it that everyone has a satisfactory social life. is the drive for endless material acquisition really an artificial creation of the advertising and marketing industry? certainly there is no innate human drive for material acquisition. there have been many cultures in which people have desired little material wealth beyond what was necessary to satisfy their basic physical needs (australian aborigines, traditional mexican peasant culture, some african cultures). on the other hand there have also been many pre-industrial cultures in which material acquisition has played an important role. so we can’t claim that today’s acquisition-oriented culture is exclusively a creation of the advertising and marketing industry. but it is clear that the advertising and marketing industry has had an important part in creating that culture. the big corporations that spend millions on advertising wouldn’t be spending that kind of money without solid proof that they were getting it back in increased sales. one member of fc met a sales manager a couple of years ago who was frank enough to tell him, “our job is to make people buy things they don’t want and don’t need.” he then described how an untrained novice could present people with the facts about a product, and make no sales at all, while a trained and experienced professional",22.06

(here it is well to note that predictions that something will not work can generally be made with greater confidence than predictions that something will work.) but reliable long-term predictions that are at all specific can seldom be made. there are exceptions. moore's law makes a specific prediction about the rate of growth of computing power, and as of 2012 the law has held true for some fifty years. but moore's law is not an inference derived from an understanding of society, it is simply a description of an empirically observed trend, and no one knows how long the trend will continue. the law may have predictable consequences for many areas of technology, but no one knows in any specific way how all this technology will interact with society as a whole. though moore's law and other empirically observed trends may play a useful role in attempts to foresee the future, it remains true that any effort to understand the development of our society must (to borrow the britannica's phrases) ""remain a tentative process ... with frequent recourse to observation and experiment ... . "" but just in case someone declines to assume that our society includes any important chaotic components, let's suppose for the sake of argument that the development of society could in principle be predicted through the solution of some stupendous system of simultaneous equations and that the necessary numerical data at the required level of precision could actually be collected. no one will claim that the computing power required to solve such a system of equations is currently available. but let's assume that the unimaginably vast computing power predicted by ray kurzweil will become a reality for some future society, and let's suppose that such a quantity of computing power would be capable of handling the enormous complexity of the present society and predicting its development over some substantial interval of time. it does not follow that a future society of that kind would have sufficient computing power to predict its own development, for such a society necessarily would be incomparably more complex than the present one: the complexity of a society will grow right along with its computing power, because the society's computational devices are part of the society. there are in fact certain paradoxes involved in the notion of a system that predicts its own behavior. these are reminiscent of russell's paradox in set theory and of the paradoxes that arise when one allows a statement to talk about itself (e.g., consider the statement, ""this statement is false""). when a system makes a prediction about its own behavior, that prediction may itself change the behavior of the system, and the change in the behavior of the system may invalidate the prediction. of course, not every statement that talks about itself is paradoxical. for example, the statement, ""this statement is in the english language"" makes perfectly good sense. similarly, many predictions that a system may make about itself will not be self-invalidating; they may even cause the system to behave in such a way as to fulfill the prediction. but it is too much to hope for that a society's predictions about itself will never be (unexpectedly) self-invalidating. c h a p t e r one : p a r t i i i a society's ability to predict its own behavior moreover would seem to require something like complete self-knowledge, and here too one runs into paradoxes. we need not discuss these here; some thought should suffice to convince the reader that any attempt to envision a system having complete self-knowledge will encounter difficulties. thus, from several points of view-past and present experience, complexity, chaos theory, and logical difficulties (paradoxes)-it is clear that no society can accurately predict its own behavior over any considerable span of time. consequently, no society can be consistently successful in planning its own future in the long term. this conclusion is in no way unusual, surprising, or original. astute observers of history have known for a long time that a society can't plan its own future. thus thurston writes: ""[n]o government has ever been able physically to manage the total existence of a country, ... or to foresee all the complications that would ensue from a decision made at the center."" heilbroner and singer write: ""technology made america a 'middleclass' nation. this process was not, of course, the outcome of anyone's decision. like much of the economic history we have traced, it followed from the blind workings of the market mechanism."" norbert elias wrote: ""[t]he actual course of ... historical change as a whole is intended and planned by no-one."" and: ""civilization ... is set in motion blindly, and kept in motion by the autonomous dynamics of a web of relationships ... . "" iii. the expected answer to the foregoing will be: even granting that the behavior of a society is unpredictable in the long term, it may nevertheless be possible to steer a society rationally by means of continual short-term interventions. to take an analogy, if we let a car without a driver roll down a rugged, irregular hillside, the only prediction we can make is that the car will not follow any predetermined course but will bounce around erratically. however, if the car has a driver, he may be able to steer it so as to avoid the worst bumps and make it roll instead through relatively smooth places. with a good deal of luck he may even be able to make the car arrive approximately at a preselected point at the foot of the hill. for these purposes the driver only needs to be able to predict very roughly how far the car will veer to the right or to the left when he turns the steering wheel. if the car veers too far or not far enough, he can correct with another turn of the wheel. perhaps something similar could be done with an entire society. it is conceivable that a combination of empirical studies with increasingly sophisticated theory may eventually make possible fairly reliable short-term predictions of the way a society will react to any given change-just as fairly reliable short-term weather forecasting has become possible. perhaps, then, a society might be successfully steered by means of frequent, intelligent interventions in such a way that undesirable outcomes could usually be avoided and some desirable outcomes achieved. the steering process would not have to be infallible; errors",26.32

(we will return to this point in a moment.) the pattern we have just outlined is a very broad and general one that can accommodate a wide variety of routes to revolutionary success. even so, given the unpredictability of historical events, it is impossible to know for certain whether the route that a revolutionary movement will actually take will fit within the pattern we've described. but the pattern is an entirely plausible one, and it provides an answer to those who think the system is too big and strong ever to be overthrown. moreover, the preparatory work that we have briefly indicated above, at a, will be appropriate for almost any route to revolution that a movement might take in reality. 12. let's return to point g, above: that the revolutionaries must avoid all hesitation or vacillation when the moment for decisive action arrives. the leaders of the movement must be astute enough to recognize the arrival of that moment. trotsky claims that in a revolutionary situation there is a particular interval of time, limited to a few weeks or at most a few months, during which a society is primed for insurrection. any attempt to bring about an insurrection must be undertaken during that interval or the opportunity will be lost. so says trotsky, and we may accept that this is true as a general rule (though of course all such rules have exceptions). trotsky was speaking only of insurrections, but it should be obvious that a similar rule applies to many other kinds of revolutionary actions: one can hope to carry them out successfully only when circumstances are favorable for them, and since circumstances change rapidly when a society is in crisis one must act at the right time; to act too soon or too late will lead to failure. here we are concerned mainly with the right moment to begin organizing on a mass basis for the final push toward the overthrow of the existing social order (as at c, above), a push that may or may not involve one or more insurrections but almost certainly will not consist merely of a single insurrection. the critical interval of time may be difficult to identify. ""lenin . . . greatly feared excessive caution, . . . a letting slip of one of those historic occasions which are decades in preparation."" on the other hand, if the revolutionaries act prematurely they may suffer a disastrous defeat. only an assiduous study of history and of revolutionary theory, with careful and thoughtful observation of current events, can develop the judgment necessary for recognition of the critical interval during which the push toward consummation of the revolution can be successfully initiated. but let's assume that the revolutionaries have correctly noted the arrival of the time to begin organizing on a mass basis for the final push. once that stage has been reached, certain guidelines need to be taken into consideration. alinsky maintains that the organizers of a mass movement must ""act in terms of specific resolutions and answers, of definiteness and certainty. to do otherwise would be to stifle organization and action, for what the organizer accepts as uncertainty would be seen by [the people he is organizing] as a terrifying chaos."" trotsky warns against ""indecisiveness"": ""the party of revolution dare not waver-no more than a surgeon dare who has plunged a knife into a sick body."" here trotsky refers to the final stage of a revolutionary process, when the existing social order is in a state of crisis and the revolutionaries are aiming directly at its overthrow. throughout this stage there is a need to maintain momentum: alinsky emphasizes that a mass movement has to remain constantly in action, avoid defeats, and keep its adversaries under unremitting pressure. trotsky says that a revolutionary process can continue only ""so long as the swing of the movement does not run into objective obstacles. when it does, there begins a reaction: disappointments of the different layers of the revolutionary class, growth of indifferentism and therewith a strengthening of the position of the counter-revolutionary forces."" however, the rule that momentum should be maintained is not unqualified: revolutionaries should not, for the sake of momentum, undertake a major action prematurely. in july 1917 the bolsheviks intentionally aborted an insurrection in st. petersburg because they judged that the time was not ripe for it. their action temporarily checked the momentum of the revolutionary process and led to a severe setback for the bolsheviks, but it averted the utterly disastrous setback that would have ensued if the insurrection had actually been attempted. nothing in this is inconsistent with the rule that revolutionaries must act decisively and without vacillation: the bolsheviks did indeed act decisively to abort an insurrection that they had done nothing to instigate and that they knew was untimely. alinsky stresses the importance of avoiding moral ambiguity. the organizers of a mass movement need to delineate issues in black and white: their own cause must be pure, noble, unequivocally good, while their adversaries represent nothing but evil. all of the movement's actions are automatically presumed to be fully justified, for any vacillation on moral or humanitarian grounds would be as fatal as vacillation on any other grounds. the fact that vacillation on moral or humanitarian grounds was likely to be fatal in any life-and-death conflict was understood by some of our most admired statesmen and soldiers-those who led the western democracies when they were locked in struggles for survival. e .g., lincoln and grant during the u. s. civil war, or churchill and roosevelt during world war ii. similarly, it is a fatal error to delay action, or to act timidly, in order to avoid offending people. for example: the bolsheviks and the mensheviks were the two revolutionary parties derived from the split in the russian social democratic labor party. in the period immediately following the st. petersburg insurrection of february 1917, trotsky says, ""the official social democratic program was still. . . common to the bolsheviks and the mensheviks, [and] the practical tasks of the democratic revolution looked the same on paper to both parties."" but, while the bolsheviks promptly undertook radical measures, the mensheviks temporized in order to avoid antagonizing the bourgeoisie and the liberals. in general, according to trotsky, the behavior of the ""compromisers"" ( menshevik and social revolutionary leaders) was ""evasive."" ""the compromisers talked themselves out of difficulties; the bolsheviks went to meet them."" the compromisers' tactics would have been appropriate under normal circumstances in a functioning parliamentary democracy, but in a revolutionary situation those same tactics were sure losers. so of course it was the bolsheviks who came out on top. the remarks in the last four paragraphs are intended to provide general guidelines for hard-core revolutionaries to take into consideration in the process of acquiring and leading a mass following when the system moves into a state of crisis; it is the volatile mass that will be incapable of tolerating uncertainty, moral ambiguity, defeats, or periods of inactivity. during the earlier stages of the movement's life, while it is diligently and patiently preparing the",23.44

achieved their specific goals, the movement as a whole has been a failure. in england and the united states during the first two thirds of the 19th century, the goal of feminists was to make women equal to men in terms of power, dignity, and opportunities within society. since this goal is a vague and general one, it's not surprising that these early feminists didn't accomplish much. but, as we saw earlier, by roughly 1870 feminists had settled on a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective: to secure for women the right to vote. perhaps because they realized that it was the key that would open the door to power for women and enable them to reach other goals, woman suffrage was the objective on which feminists concentrated their efforts until that objective was achieved in the 1920s. since the 1920s the feminist movement has had no single, clear, concrete objective. the movement has splintered into various factions that pursue diverse objectives and are often in conflict with one another. nevertheless, rule (i) notwithstanding, feminists have continued to make steady progress toward their general goal-to make women equal to men in power, dignity, and opportunities. however, the feminists have had certain critically important advantages that have offset their neglect of rule (i). first, the achievement of the earlier feminists' well-chosen central objective-the right to vote-has given women collective power: no politician who hopes to win an election can afford to ignore women's wants. more importantly, the tide of history has been working in the feminists' favor. ever since the onset of the industrial revolution there has been a powerful trend toward ""equality""-meaning the elimination of all distinctions between individuals other than those distinctions that are demanded by the needs of the technological system. thus, a mathematician is to be evaluated in terms of his/her mathematical talent, a mechanic in terms of his/her knowledge of engines, a factory manager in terms of his/her ability to run a factory, and with the passage of time it has increasingly been expected that the religion, social class, race, gender, etc., etc. of the mathematician, the mechanic, and the manager are to be treated as irrelevant. because the feminists' goal of equality has been in harmony with this historical trend, opposition to feminism has steadily declined over time, and from 1975 at the latest the media and the cultural and political climate have been overwhelmingly favorable to gender equality. a comparison of post-1945 british and american feminism with the mexican civil society movement provides an illustration of the principle that the stronger the opposition a movement has to face, the more important it is that the movement should concentrate all its energy on a single, clearly defined objective. the feminists have made steady progress toward their vague goal of gender equality, in part because they have faced no very serious opposition since the middle of the 20th century. but the mexican civil society movement has faced very tough opposition from politicians and technocrats unwilling to relinquish their power, and the movement has therefore been doomed by its failure to concentrate on a single, clear, concrete objective. in connection with rule (i) it is also instructive to look at the history of ireland. from at least 1711 until the 1880s, there was chronic rural unrest in ireland due to the wretched conditions in which irish peasants had to live. in 1798 there was an attempt at violent revolution, but it failed miserably, in large part because it was unorganized, undisciplined, and lacked a clear objective. the irish began to make progress only with the advent of daniel o'connell. o'connell was a political genius and a spellbinding orator, but unlike many other political geniuses he was a sincere patriot who had genuinely dedicated himself to the welfare of his country. o'connell's ultimate objective was ""the improvement of the lot of the irish common people."" as a step toward this vague and general goal, o'connell set himself a clear and concrete objective, namely, ""catholic emancipation,"" which meant repeal of the laws that subjected irish catholics to certain political disabilities (for example, they were not allowed to become judges or members of parliament). catholic emancipation would directly benefit only a small minority who could hope to occupy important offices or be elected to parliament, but it would indirectly benefit the overwhelmingly catholic peasants of ireland inasmuch as it would give them representation in parliament and (more importantly) prove that they could prevail over the british government through collective action. o'connell created an amazingly well-organized and well-disciplined movement dedicated to the specific goal of catholic emancipation, and that goal was achieved within about six years. catholic emancipation undoubtedly would have occurred eventually anyway, since it was a development that was guaranteed by the same historical trend toward ""equality"" that favored the feminist movement. but, without o'connell and his organization, catholic emancipation probably would have been delayed for some years, for when emancipation was granted in 1829 it was granted grudgingly, and it very likely would not have been granted at that time at all if o'connell had not played skillfully upon the government's fear of another violent uprising like that of 1798. (it is worth noting, therefore, that the 1798 rebellion, even though it was ruthlessly crushed, was not in vain.) needless to say, excellent organization in pursuit of a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective does not guarantee success. in 1840, o'connell founded a repeal association for the purpose of securing the repeal of the act of union that placed england and ireland under a single parliament. the objective was not to separate ireland from england but to create a specifically irish parliament, while ireland would remain united with england under a single sovereign. again o'connell built a highly disciplined movement that had broad support among the irish people, but this time he failed to achieve his objective, for the british government and parliament remained obdurate, and the act of union was not repealed. a contributing factor in the failure of o'connell's repeal association was the great potato famine of 1846-49. when peasants were starving to death in droves, o'connell's political goal seemed irrelevant to them. in 1847, during the famine, a faction within the repeal association formed a new organization called the irish confederation. the new group soon recognized that it needed some specific goal, but apparently was unable to agree on one until the revolutions of 1848 broke out on the european continent. inspired by these events, the irish confederation adopted violent revolution as its goal, presumably for the purpose of making ireland independent of britain. that same year an uprising attempted by the radicals failed, in part because of the radicals' incompetence, but even more because they had no popular support. the common people were concerned only with their own immediate material welfare, or indeed with their very survival, and had little interest in the confederation's nationalism. by 1856, a leader named james stephens (a survivor of the 1848 uprising) had definitely settled on the clear, concrete objective of total political independence for ireland. independence was to be followed by the establishment of a ""republic,""77 but the imprecision of this second goal was perhaps not very important, because a republic would not be established until independence had been achieved. thus, the imprecise goal of founding a republic would not necessarily interfere with efforts toward the clear and specific goal ofindependence. (compare the case of the american revolutionaries, discussed above.) stephens, a brilliant organizer, created a powerful revolutionary movement that in 1867 attempted an uprising for the purpose of separating ireland from britain. for reasons not relevant to the present discussion, the uprising failed ignominiously. but from that time until 1916 the aspiration for total independence from britain was kept alive by a minuscule minority of extreme nationalists who had virtually no support among the general population ofilreland. irish peasants at first were concerned only to secure relief from the oppression of the landlords, and had no interest in nationalist ideals. eventual relief of the peasants' suffering was guaranteed by the general liberalizing trend of western civilization, but the process was accelerated by the efforts of parnell and gladstone, so that the condition of the peasants was alleviated step by step until by 1910 at the latest they no longer had any grievance serious enough to provide a motive for radical action. thus, by the second decade of the 20th century, the irish no longer had any plausible reason to separate themselves from britain, nor did such a separation have the appearance of a historical inevitability. nevertheless, the extremists' stubborn persistence in adhering to their goal of total independence did pay off in the end. it is a remarkable fact that between 1916 and 1921 the tiny minority of extreme nationalists, who at first lacked significant support, were able to swing the majority of the irish population over to their side. through terroristic tactics and guerrilla warfare, the nationalists provoked the british government to harsh countermeasures",28.3

to pursue. scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. but for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. for example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the “fulfillment” they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn. for many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). one indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. thus the moneymaker constantly strives for more and more wealth. the scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. the long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the “mundane” business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. more importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs autonomously but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. in contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities. autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. but most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. it is usually enough to act as a member of a small group. thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. but if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need for the power process will not be served. the same is true when decisions are made on a collective basis if the group making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. it is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. and then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power (the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors). but for most people it is through the power process having a goal, making an autonomous effort and attaining the goal -- that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. when one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders. etc. any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale. we aren’t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. this sort of thing is not normal for human societies. there is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. it is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. abuse of women was common among the australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the american indian tribes. but it does appear that generally speaking the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society. we attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. it is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. but it is not the only one. before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources. among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe. it is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. the degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress. all pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. the industrial revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people’s hands. for example, a variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. if the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. if their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. but if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.) for primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. in the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. thus there is no stable framework. the conservatives are fools: they whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. apparently it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values. the breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional smallscale social groups. the disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. beyond that, a technological society has to weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. in modern society an individual’s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a smallscale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system. suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin, his friend or his co-religionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job. he has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is “nepotism” or “discrimination,” both of which are terrible sins in modern society. would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (look at latin america.) thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are emasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of social problems. but we do not believe they are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today. a few pre-industrial cities were very large and crowded, yet their inhabitants do not seem to have suffered from psychological problems to the same extent as modern man. in america today there still are uncrowded rural areas, and we find there the same problems as in urban areas, though the problems tend to be less acute in the rural areas. thus crowding does not seem to be",22.73

(we don't mean to sneer at the ""plantation darkies"" of the old south. to their credit, most of the slaves were not content with their servitude. we do sneer at people who are content with servitude.) 79. some pe«ple may have some exceptional drive, in pursuing which they satisfy their need for the power process. for example, those who have an unusually strong drive for social status may spend their whole lives climbing the status ladder without ever getting bored with that game. 80. people vary in their susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. some people are so susceptible that, even if they make a great deal of money, they cannot satisfy their constant craving for the shiny new toys that the marketing industry dangles before their eyes. so they always feel hard-pressed financially even if their income is large, and their cravings are frustrated. 81. some pe«ple have low susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. these are the people who aren't interested in money. material acquisition does not serve their need for the power process. 82. people who have medium susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques are able to earn enough money to satisfy their craving for goods and services, but «nly at the cost of serious effort (putting in overtime, taking a second job, earning promotions, etc.). thus material acquisition serves their need for the power process. but it does not necessarily follow that their need is fully satisfied. they may have insufficient autonomy in the power process (their work may consist of following orders) and some of their drives may be frustrated (e.g., security, aggression). (we are guilty of oversimplification in paragraphs 80-82 because wc have assumed that the desire for material acquisition is entirely a creation of the advertising and marketing industry. of course it's not that simple.) 83. some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves with a powerful organization or mass movement. an individual lacking goals or power joins a movement or an organization, adopts its goals as his own, then works toward these goals. when some of the goals are attained, the individual, even though his personal efforts have played only an insignificant part in the attainment of the goals, feels (through his identification with the movement or organization) as if he had gone through the power process. this phenomenon was exploited by the fascists, nazis and communists. our society uses it too, though less crudely. example: manuel noriega was an irritant to the u.s. (goal: punish noriega). the u.s. invaded panama (effort) and punished noriega (attainment of goal). the u.s. went through the power process and many americans, because of their identifi cation with the u.s., experienced the power process vicariously. hence the widespread public approval of the panama invasion; it gave people a sense of power. we see the same phenomenon in armies, corporations, political parties, humanitarian organizations, religious or ideological movements. in particular, leftist movements tend to attract people who are seeking to satisfy their need for power. but for most people identification with a large organization or a mass movement does not fully satisfy the need for power. 84. another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is through surrogate activities. as we explained in paragraphs 38-40, a surrogate activity is an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that the individual pursues for the sake of the ""fulfillment"" that he gets from pursuing the goal, not because he needs to attain the goal itself. for instance, there is no practical motive for building enormous muscles, hitting a little white ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage stamps. yet many people in our society devote themselves with passion to bodybuilding, golf or stamp-collecting. some people are more ""other-directed"" than others, and therefore will more readily attach importance to a surrogate activity simply because the people around them treat it as important or because society tells them it is important, lhat is why some people get very serious about essentially trivial activities such as sports, or bridge, or chess, or arcane scholarly pursuits,whereas others who are more clear-sighted never see these things as anything but the surrogate activities that they are, and consequently never attach enough importance to them to satisfy their need for the power process in that way. it only remains to point out that in many cases a person's way of earning a living is also a surrogate activity. not a pure surrogate activity, since part of the motive for the activity is to gain the physical necessities and (for some people) social status and the luxuries that advertising makes them want. but many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary to earn whatever money and status they require, and this extra effort constitutes a surrogate activity. this extra effort, together with the emotional investment that accompanies it, is one of the most potent forces acting toward the continual development and perfecting of the system, with negative consequences for individual freedom. (see paragraph 131.) especially, for the most creative scientists and engineers, work tends to be largely a surrogate activity. this point is so important that it deserves a separate discussion, which we shall give in a moment (paragraphs 87-92). 85. in this section we have explained how many people in modern society do satisfy their need for the power process to a greater or lesser extent. but we think that for the majority of people the need for the power process is not fully satisfied. in the first place, those who have an insatiable drive for status, or who get firmly ""hooked"" on a surrogate activity, or who identify strongly enough with a movement or organization to satisfy their need for power in that way, are exceptional personalities. others are not fully satisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an organization. (see paragraphs 41, 64.) in the second place, too much control is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through socialization, which results in a deficiency of autonomy, and in f rustration due to the impossibility of attaining certain goals and the necessity of restraining too many impulses. 86. but even if most people in industrial-technological society were well satisfied, we (fc) would still be opposed to that form of society, because (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one's need for the power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an organization, rather than through pursuit of real goals. 87. science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities. some scientists claim that they are motivated by ""curiosity"" or by a desire to ""benefit humanity."" but it is easy to see that neither of these can be the principal motive of most scientists. as for ""curiosity,"" that notion is simply absurd. most scientists work on highly specialized problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. for example, is an astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? of course not. only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a new species of beetle? no. that question is of interest only to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity. if the chemist and the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they wouldn't give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the classifi cation of beetles. suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist. in that case he would have been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. in any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. the ""curiosity"" explanation for the scientists' motive just doesn't stand up. 88. the ""benefit of humanity"" explanation doesn't work any better. some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human race — most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for example. some other areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities. yet scientists in these areas are just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop vaccines or study air pollution. consider the case of dr. edward teller, who had an obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclear power plants. did this involvement stem from a desire to benefit humanity? if so, then why didn't dr. teller get emotional about other ""humanitarian"" causes? if he was such",20.27

human beings will be transformed step by step into man-machine hybrids (cyborgs), or even into pure machines, that will be incomparably more intelligent than their human ancestors. with their superior intelligence, these beings will be able to use the technological miracles of the future to guide the development of their society rationally."" however, none of the arguments of chapter one (with one exception, noted below) depend on the limitations of human intelligence or on any weaknesses peculiar to human beings, so there is every reason to think that the arguments will remain valid for a society derived from the present one through the piecemeal replacement of humans by machines in the manner envisioned by kurzweil. b. the technophiles won't be rash enough to claim that any future technological miracle will make it possible for a society to predict its own development over any substantial interval of time. but some, perhaps, will point to the fact that the modern mathematical theory of control now makes it possible-in some cases-to design mechanisms that will keep a complex system on a fixed course even if only the short-term ""effect of any potential control action applied to the system"" can be predicted (though the effect must be predictable ""precisely .. . under all possible environmental circumstances""). but in the context of control theory a system is called ""complex"" if ""the efforts of many persons and the use of special technical equipment (computers) are required to draw the whole picture,"" and examples of""complex"" systems are "" [t]he launch of a spaceship, the 24-hour operation of a power plant, oil refinery, or chemical factory, the control of air traffic near a large airport."" in the present discussion we are dealing with an entirely different level of complexity. any one power plant, oil refinery, or chemical factory is extremely simple in comparison with an entire modern society. actually, a careful reading of what the britannica says about control theory will give scant encouragement to anyone who might like to believe that the theory would make possible the rational control of the development of an entire society. among other reasons, control theory generally ""is applicable to any concrete situation . . . [only when] that situation can be described, with high precision, by a [mathematical] model,"" and the applicability of the theory is limited by ""the agreement between available models and the actual behavior of the system to be controlled."" for control of an entire society one would need a precise mathematical model of, among other things, human behavior (or of the behavior of cyborgs or of machines descended from humans, which in kurzweil's vision would be far more complex even than human beings themselves). in special contexts, as when one needs only statistical information about human behavior, adequate models may be possible. e.g., in a marketing study one may be unconcerned with the actions of individuals; one may need only such information as the percentage of consumers who will buy a given product in specified circumstances. but for control of an entire society one would need a precise mathematical model of the behavior of each single one of numerous persons (whether human persons or machine-persons) including, at the least, all those who occupy positions of special importance (political leaders, toplevel government officials, military officers, corporation executives, etc.) and whose individual behavior interacts continuously with the society as a whole and has a significant effect on it. all the same, let's make the extremely daring assumption that a precise mathematical model of our entire society could actually be constructed. even so, it is wildly improbable that sufficient computing power could ever be available to handle the trillions upon trillions upon trillions of simultaneous equations that would be involved. remember what we pointed out in part ii of chapter one: that sixty trillion equations would be required just for prices in the u.s. economy alone, leaving out of account all other factors in u. s. and world society; and that even if some future society had enough computing power for control of the present society, it wouldn't have enough to control its own development, because the complexity of a society grows right along with its computing power. finally, even if enough computing power were available, it would be impracticable to collect the stupendous amount of minutely detailed, highly precise information that would be required for insertion of the appropriate numbers into the equations. thus, it is safe to conclude that no society will ever be able to set up a mathematically designed control system that will keep the society forever on a fixed course of development. let us nevertheless carry to the utmost extreme our generosity toward the true-believing technophiles: let's grant them the impossible and assume that such a control system could successfully be designed. even under this assumption we still run up against fundamental difficulties: who is going to decide what objectives are to guide the design of the control system that is to keep the society on a fixed course of development, and what fixed course of development should be chosen for the society? and how will the society be induced to accept the control system and the chosen course of development? if the control system is to be approved by the public at large it will have to be a compromise solution that in trying to satisfy everyone will satisfy no one. in practice, it is unlikely that such a compromise could ever win general acceptance, so any control system would have to be forcibly imposed by an authoritarian",31.25

[i]deas, theories, plans or programmes are usually altered partially and sometimes even wholly, because of the discovery of unforeseen circumstances in the course of practice. that is to say, it does happen that the original ideas, theories, plans or programmes fail to correspond with reality either in whole or in part and are wholly or partially incorrect. in many instances, failures have to be corrected many times before errors in knowledge can be corrected and . . . the anticipated results can be achieved in practice . . . . . . . [t]rue revolutionary leaders must not only be good at correcting their ideas, theories, plans or programmes when errors are discovered, . . . but . . . they must ensure that the proposed new revolutionary tasks and new working programmes correspond to the new changes in the situation. this is one way of describing the need for flexibility. 5. as argued in chapter three, the single ultimate goal of a revolutionary movement today must be the total collapse of the worldwide technological system. one of this writer's correspondents has suggested that, because of the acute physical danger and hardship to which everyone would be exposed following a collapse of the technological system, a movement that takes such a collapse as its goal will be resisted by the overwhelming majority of the world's population and therefore will be unable to accomplish anything. undoubtedly, if you held a referendum today on the question of whether the system should be made to collapse, ninety percent, at the very least, of the inhabitants of industrialized countries would vote ""no."" even in a crisis situation in which people had lost all respect for and all confidence in the system, it may well be that a majority, though a much smaller one, would still vote against total collapse. but the assumption that this would be a serious obstacle to revolution is based on what we may call the ""democratic fallacy"": the notion that the number of people favoring one side or another determines the outcome of social struggles as it determines the outcome of democratic elections. actually the outcome of social struggles is determined not primarily by numbers but by the dynamics of social movements. 6. it goes without saying that the real revolutionaries-the members of the deeply committed cadre that forms the core of the movement-will be prepared to accept any amount of hardship and the greatest risk, or even a certainty, of death in the service of their cause. we need only think of the early christian martyrs; of al �eda, the taliban, and the islamic suicide bombers; or of the assassins of the russian revolution. after a social revolutionary named kalyaev assassinated a russian grand duke in 1905, the duke's wife visited him in prison and told him: ""repent . . . and i will beg the sovereign to give you your life."" kalyaev replied: ""no! i do not repent. i must die for my deed and i will . . . . my death will be more useful to my cause than [the grand duke's] death."" later, in 1918, when fanny kaplan put two bullets into lenin, she surely realized that she would pay with her life. similarly, when charlotte corday assassinated jean-paul marat during the french revolution, she must have known that she would face the guillotine. the extreme irish nationalists who carried out the uprising of april 1916 certainly knew that they were taking desperate risks, and a minority among them were intentionally seeking martyrdom. many of those who were subsequently executed ""expressed in their last words . . . confidence that their deaths were a sort of triumph."" 7. but it's not only a tiny minority of hard-core revolutionaries who will accept suffering and the gravest risks in the service of what they regard as critically important goals. many ordinary people become heroes and show astonishing courage when there is a severe disruption of their society or an acute threat to their most cherished values, or when they are inspired by what seems to them a noble purpose. it has been said that ""man is capable of standing superhuman suffering if only he feels sure that there is some point and purpose to it."" this statement has been confirmed by experience, not only in the histories of the french, russian, and other revolutions, but in many other situations as well. in world war ii, for instance, the russians never lost their will to resist in the face of the death, destruction, and savage cruelties inflicted on them by the german invaders. for that matter, the morale of the german civilian population was never broken by the horrific allied bombing campaigns that reduced many of their cities to rubble and sometimes killed tens of thousands of people in a single operation. the allied air-crews who carried out bombing and other missions in disputed air-space over europe suffered in turn a frightful rate of attrition. for example, of the american pilots who undertook missions over german-occupied poland during world war ii, about three out of four were killed. yet the survivors kept flying. meanwhile, on the ground, many infantrymen suffered equal danger and far greater physical hardship, but they too continued to fight. most of the civilians in the examples of the foregoing paragraph did not suffer hardship or danger voluntarily; they showed their courage merely by continuing to function well under the atrocious conditions imposed on them by circumstances beyond their control. some of the military men no doubt volunteered for service, but probably many of these at the time they volunteered failed to appreciate fully what they were getting into. this was certainly the case with audie murphy, the most decorated american soldier of world war ii, who was totally nai:ve about war when he enlisted. yet there are abundant examples of people-not just a tiny minority of hard-core revolutionaries, but large numbers of more-or-less ordinary people-who in critical situations have voluntarily chosen to take desperate risks, with what we can assume was full knowledge of what they were risking, in the service of a cause or in fulfillment of what they believed to be their duty. in 1922, when the irish war of lndependence had gone on long enough so that its desperate and bloody character was unmistakable, there was still no shortage of recruits, ""new eager young warriors anxious to emulate their elders."" nor does there seem to have been any shortage of recruits to the french and polish resistance movements during world war ii. these risked not only death, as the irish did, but excruciating torture as well. charles de gaulle's personal representative with the french resistance, jean moulin, was captured and tortured to death by the gestapo, yet he never cracked, never gave up his secrets. ""in 1941 free france had sent captain scamaroni to [corsica] with a mission to prepare action there . . . . unfortunately, our valiant delegate had fallen into the hands of the italians . . . . tortured horribly, scamaroni had died to keep his secrets."" even for causes in which they have no personal stake, some people will risk death, and worse. thus thousands of non-jewish poles participated in efforts to save jews from the nazis. in helpingjews the poles risked death not only for themselves but for their families as well. a polish woman named irena sendler, credited with helping to save 2,500 jewish children, ""was captured by the nazis in 1943 and tortured but refused to say who her co-conspirators were. during one session her captors broke her feet and legs . . . . "" she survived only because her comrades in the resistance bribed a gestapo officer to help her escape. it should be noted, too, that whether they are hard-core revolutionaries or ordinary people, whether they assume their risks voluntarily or involuntarily, many of those who go through extreme danger or hardship for what they believe to be worthy purposes experience deep fulfillment from their ""heroic"" activities. they may even enjoy them. a former inmate of a german prisoner-of-war camp in world war ii wrote of his unsuccessful and eventually successful attempts to escape: i feel i have quaffed deeply of the intoxicating cup of excitement . . . . i can think of no sport that is the peer of escape, where freedom, life, and loved ones are the prize of victory, and death the possible though by no means inevitable price of failure. as world war ii drew to",14.85

(we see this happening already. there are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work, because for intellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves useful in the present system.) on those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: they will need more and more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, conf orming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism. their tasks will be increasingly specialized so that their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world, being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality. the system will have to use any means that it can, whether psychological or biological, to engineer people to be docile, to have the abilities that the system requires and to ""sublimate"" their drive for power into some specialized task. but the statement that the people of such a society will have to be docile may require qualification. the society may find competitiveness useful, provided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that serve the needs of the system. we can imagine a future society in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige and power. but no more than a very few people will ever reach the top, where the only real power is (see end of paragraph 163). very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his need for power only by pushing large numbers of other people out of the way and depriving them of their opportunity f«r power. 176. one can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the possibilities that we have just discussed. for instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. it has been suggested, for example, that a great development of the service industries might provide work for human beings. thus people would spend their time shining each other's shoes, driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other's tables, etc. this seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy- work. they would seek other, dangerous outlets (drugs, crime, ""cults,"" hate groups) unless they were biologically or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such a way of life. 177. needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities.lhey only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. but we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we've just described. it is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: individuals (at least those of the ""bourgeois"" type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who theref ore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more ""socialized"" than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent ) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of god's will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). in the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed. 178. whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating for human beings a new physical and social environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural selection has adapted the human race physically and psychologically. if man is not adjusted to this new environment by being artificially re-engineered, then he will be adapted to it through a long and painf ul process of natural selection. the former is far more likely than the latter. 179. it would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences. 180. the technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us, yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable. but we (fc) don't think it is inevitable. we think it can be stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it. 181. as we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology",28.85

""it has been estimated that the modern sediment loads of the rivers draining into the atlantic ocean may be four to five times greater than the prehistoric rates because of the effects of human activity."" how, in the long run, will this affect life in the ocean? does anyone know? genes from genetically engineered organisms can, and almost certainly will, be passed to wild plants or animals. what will be the ultimate consequences for the biosphere of this ""genetic pollution?"" no one knows. even if these and other effects turn out to be harmless when considered separately and individually, all of the ""harmless"" effects of the system's activities taken together will surely bring about major alterations in the biosphere. here we've done no more than scratch the surface. a full assessment of the ways in which the functioning of the technological world-system currently threatens to disrupt the biosphere would require a vast amount of research, and the results would fill several volumes. will all of these factors add up to a disruption of the biosphere sufficient to prevent it from performing its function in maintaining the present composition of our atmosphere? it's anybody's guess. but that's not all: let's not forget that the technological system is still in its infancy in comparison with what it will become over the next several decades. at a rapidly accelerating pace and in ways that no one has yet imagined, we can expect the world's leading self-prop systems to find more and more opportunities to exploit, more and more resources to extract, more and more corners to invade, until little or nothing on this planet is left free of technological intervention-intervention that will be carried out in a mad quest for immediate increments of power and without regard to long-term consequences. in the opinion of this writer, there is a strong probability that if the biosphere is not destroyed outright it will at least be rendered incapable of maintaining any reasonable approximation to the present composition of our atmosphere, without which none of the more complex forms of life on this planet will be able to survive. one plausible outcome might be that the earth will end up like the planet venus: it has been suggested that the climate of the earth could be ultimately unstable. addition of gasses capable of trapping heat could accelerate the release of h20 and raise the temperature to a point where the oceans would evaporate . . . . some believe that such changes may have occurred on venus . . . . venus is a striking example of the importance of the greenhouse effect. its atmosphere contains a large concentration of c02 [ carbon dioxide]. . . . [t]he venusian surface = temperature is much hotter than the earth's-about 780° k [507° c or 944° f]-in spite of the fact that venus absorbs less energy from the sun because of its ubiquitous cloud cover .. . . "" to sum up the thesis of this part of the present chapter: if the development of the technological world-system is allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion, it will in all probability leave the earth uninhabitable for all of the more complex forms of life as we know them today. this admittedly remains unproven; it represents the author's personal opinion. but the facts and arguments offered here are enough at least to show that the opinion can be entertained as a plausible hypothesis, and that it would be rash to assume without further proof that the denouement we are facing will be no worse than earlier extinction events in the earth's history. what can be taken as a near certainty is that-if the development of the technological system is allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion-the outcome for the biosphere will be thoroughly devastating; if it isn't worse than the extinction event at the end of the cretaceous when the dinosaurs disappeared, it can't be much better; if any humans are left alive, they will be very few; and the technological system itself will be dead. but note the reservation in the foregoing statement: "" if the development of the technological system is allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion,"" the author has occasionally been asked: ""if the system is going to destroy itself anyway, then why bother to overthrow it?"" the answer, of course, is that if the technological system were eliminated now a great deal could still be saved. the longer the system is allowed to continue its development, the worse will be the outcome for the biosphere and for the human race, and the greater will be the risk that the earth will be left a dead planet. v. the techies' wet-dreams. there is a current of thought that appears to be carrying many technophiles out of the realm of science and into that of science fiction. for convenience, let's refer to those who ride this current as ""the techies."" the current runs through several channels; not all techies think alike. what they have in common is that they take highly speculative ideas about the future of technology as near certainties, and on that basis predict the arrival within the next few decades of a kind of technological utopia. some of the techies' fantasies are astonishingly grandiose. for example, ray kurzweil believes that ""[w]ithin a matter of centuries, human intelligence will have re-engineered and saturated all the matter in the universe."" the writing of kevin kelly, another techie, is often so vague as to border on the meaningless, but he seems to say much the same thing that kurzweil does about human conquest of the universe: ""the universe is mostly empty because it is waiting to be filled with the products oflife and the technium . . . . "" ""the technium"" is kelly's name for the technological world-system that humans have created here on earth. most versions of the technological utopia include immortality (at least for techies) among their other marvels. the immortality to which the techies believe themselves destined is conceived in any one of three forms: (i) the indefinite preservation of the living human body as it exists today; (ii) the merging of humans with machines and the indefinite survival of the resulting man-machine hybrids; (iii) the ""uploading"" of minds from human brains into robots or computers, after which the uploaded minds are to live forever within",23.08

maybe, but maybe not. in the first place, revolutionaries will not be able to break the system down unless it is already in enough trouble so that there would be a good chance of its eventually breaking down by itself anyway; and the bigger the system grows, the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will be; so it may be that revolutionaries, by hastening the onset of the breakdown, will be reducing the extent of the disaster. in the second place, one has to balance struggle and death against the loss of freedom and dignity. to many of us, freedom and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain. besides, we all have to die some time, and it may be better to die fighting for survival, or for a cause, than to live a long but empty and purposeless life. in the third place, it is not at all certain that survival of the system will lead to less suffering than breakdown of the system would. the system has already caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffering all over the world. ancient cultures, that for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory relationship with each other and with their environment, have been shattered by contact with industrial society, and the result has been a whole catalogue of economic, environmental, social and psychological problems. one of the effects of the intrusion of industrial society has been that over much of the world traditional controls on population have been thrown out of balance. hence the population explosion, with all that that implies. then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread throughout the supposedly fortunate countries of the west (see paragraphs 44, 45). no one knows what will happen as a result of ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen. and, as nuclear proliferation has shown, new technology cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible third world nations. would you like to speculate about what iraq or north korea will do with genetic engineering? “oh!” say the technophiles, “science is going to fix all that! we will conquer famine, eliminate psychological suffering, make everybody healthy and happy!” yeah, sure. that’s what they said 200 years ago. the industrial revolution was supposed to eliminate poverty, make everybody happy, etc. the actual result has been quite different. the technophiles are hopelessly naive (or self-deceiving) in their understanding of social problems. they are unaware of (or choose to ignore) the fact that when large changes, even seemingly beneficial ones, are introduced into a society, they lead to a long sequence of other changes, most of which are impossible to predict (paragraph 103). the result is disruption of the society. so it is very probable that in their attempts to end poverty and disease, engineer docile, happy personalities and so forth, the technophiles will create social systems that are terribly troubled, even more so than the present once. for example, the scientists boast that they will end famine by creating new, genetically engineered food plants. but this will allow the human population to keep expanding indefinitely, and it is well known that crowding leads to increased stress and aggression. this is merely one example of the predictable problems that will arise. we emphasize that, as past experience has shown, technical progress will lead to other new problems that cannot be predicted in advance (paragraph 103). in fact, ever since the industrial revolution, technology has been creating new problems for society far more rapidly than it has been solving old ones. thus it will take a long and difficult period of trial and error for the technophiles to work the bugs out of their brave new world (if they every do). in the meantime there will be great suffering. so it is not at all clear that the survival of industrial society would involve less suffering than the breakdown of that society would. technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is not likely to be any easy escape. but suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decades and that the bugs do eventually get worked out of the system, so that it functions smoothly. what kind of system will it be? we will consider several possibilities. first let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings can do them. in that case presumably all work will be done by vast, highly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary. either of two cases might occur. the machines might be permitted to make all of their own decisions without human oversight, or else human control over the machines might be retained. if the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can’t make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. we only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines. it might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all power to the machines. but we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power. what we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines’ decisions. as society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. at that stage the machines will be in effective control. people won’t be able to just turn the machine off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide. on the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained. in that case the average man may have control over certain private machines of his own, such as his car or his personal computer, but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite -- just as it is today, but with two differences. due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous,",22.73

""even in the short run, the cost of the divisive factionalism that the reforms generated had disastrous effects."" opposition to wang was so intense that he resigned permanently in 1076, and during the eight years following shenzong's death in 1085 most of the reforms were rescinded or drastically revised. under two subsequent emperors, zhezong (che-tsung; reigned in effect, circa 1093-1100) and huizong (hui-tsung; reigned 1100-1126), some of the reforms were restored, but ""wang's own former associates were gone, and his policies became nothing more than an instrument in bitter political warfare."" ""[a]lthough emperor huizong's reign saw some of the reform measures reinstated, the atmosphere at his court was not one of high-minded commitment,""but was characterized by ""debased political behavior."" ""leading officials engaged in corrupt practices,"" and the rapacity of the emperor's agents ""aroused serious revolts of people who in desperation took up arms against them."" the fall of the northern song (sung) dynasty in 1126-27 marked the final demise of whatever was left of wang's reforms. norbert elias makes clear that the ""absolute"" monarchs of the ""age of absolutism"" in europe were not so absolute as they seemed. for example, louis xiv of france is generally seen a s the archetype of the ""absolute"" monarch; he could probably have had any individual's head chopped off at will. but by no means could he use his power freely: the vast human network that louis xiv ruled ha[ d] its own momentum and its own centre of gravity which he had to respect. it cost immense effort and self-control to preserve the balance of people and groups and, by playing on the tensions, to steer the whole. elias might have added that louis xiv could ""steer"" his realm only within certain narrow limits. elias himself refers elsewhere to ""the realization that even the most absolute government is helpless in the face of the dynamisms of social development ... . "" the theoretically absolute emperor joseph ii ruled austria from 1780 to 1790 and instituted major reforms of a ""progressive"" (i.e., modernizing) character. but: ""by 1787 resistance to joseph and his government was intensifying . ... resistance simmered in the austrian netherlands ... . ""[by 1789]. .. the war [against the turks] caused an outpouring of popular agitation against his foreign policy, the people of the austrian netherlands rose in outright revolution, and reports of trouble in galicia increased . ... ""faced with these difficulties, joseph revoked many of the reforms that he had enacted earlier. ... "" ... joseph ii] tried to do too much too quickly and so died a deeply disappointed man."" especially to be noted is the fact that joseph ii failed even though most of his reforms were modernizing ones; that is, they merely attempted to accelerate austria's movement in obedience to a powerful pre-existing trend in european history. revolutionary dictators of the 20th century, such as hitler and stalin, were probably more powerful than traditional ""absolute"" monarchs, because the revolutionary character of their regimes had done away with many of the traditional, formal or informal social structures and customary restraints that had curbed the ""legitimate"" monarchs' exercise of their power. but even the revolutionary dictators' power was in practice far less than absolute. during the 1930s, when the hitler regime was rearming germany in preparation for anticipated warfare, resistance by the working class ""kept the government from curtailing the production of consumers' goods, although civilian output interfered seriously with arms production."" it is said that, from 1938, resistance to the regime included some ten attempts to kill hitler or otherwise remove him from power. the most important of these efforts was initiated in 1943 by a conspiracy of civilian dignitaries and military officers, who on july 20, 1944 tried to blow the fuhrer up with a bomb, after which they planned to seize control of the government. the assassination attempt was nearly successful, and it was only through luck that hitler escaped with his life. it appears that many of the conspirators were motivated not only by the fact that hitler had gotten them into a losing war, but also by disgust at the atrocities that germans, under nazi leadership, were committing against jews, slavs, and other groups. in the soviet union between 1934 and 1941, the stalin regime was unable to regulate its own labor force, for the ""demand for labor created a situation that overrode ... the efforts of the regime to control labor through legislation."" the government naturally wanted a stable work force in which workers would remain at their jobs as long as they were needed, but in practice they ""continued to change jobs at a high rate."" laws were evaded or simply ignored, and ""hardly slowed down the movement of workers."" more significantly, the terror of the middle to late 1930s was not a calculated and effective measure undertaken by stalin to crush resistance to his rule. instead, a frightened dictator initiated a process that rapidly spiraled out of his control. ""stalin was a man initiating and reacting to developments, not the cold mastermind of a plot to subdue the party and the nation."" ""it now appears that stalin and his close associates, having helped create a tense and ugly atmosphere, nonetheless repeatedly reacted [during the terror] to events they had not planned or foreseen."" ""an atmosphere of panic had set in reminiscent of the european witch-hunts ... . "" ""stalin seems to have become steadily more worried as the purges uncovered alleged spies and trotskyites. finally he struck at them, almost incoherently. during 1937 and 1938 events spun out of ... control."" ""[t]he police fabricated cases, tortured people not targeted in stalin's directives, and became a power unto themselves."" ""terror was producing avoidance of responsibility, which was dysfunctional. whatever the goal at the top, events were again out of control.""

(even so, scientific rationality is consistently applied only where it is useful to those who apply it. scientific rationality is commonly set aside when the irrational is more useful, for example, in certain aspects of the social sciences where the goal is not to describe reality accurately but to provide support for an ideology or a worldview.) the power-structure of a modern society can change human behavior by preaching on a vast scale through the mass media with the help of skilled professional propagandists. maybe a group outside the established power-structure could also change human behavior through propaganda alone, but only if the group were sufficiently rich and powerful to undertake a massive, sophisticated media campaign. even where human behavior is changed by professional propagandists, however, it is doubtful that the change is ever permanent. it seems that such changes are easily reversed when the propaganda ceases or is replaced by propaganda that promotes contrary ideas. thus, the effects of nazi propaganda in germany, marxist leninist propaganda in the soviet union, and maoist propaganda in china faded rather quickly when those systems of propaganda were discontinued. postulate 3. probably every radical movement tends to some extent to attract persons who join it from motives that are only loosely related to the goals of the movement. when earth first! was founded in the 1980s, its goal was simply the defense of wilderness, but it attracted numerousnindividuals of leftist type who were less interested in wilderness than in activism for its own sake. a good example was the late judi bari, who was a radical feminist, demonstrated against u.s. involvement in central america, and participated in the pro-choice and anti-nuclear movements. ""eventually, she added environmentalism to her list of causes"" and became an earth first!er. the influx of numerous individuals of this type did lead to the blurring of earth first!'s original mission, which became contaminated with ""social justice"" issues. probably, however, not every radical movement is equally attractive to persons whose goals differ from those of the movement. because of the personal risk involved, it's not likely that an illegal and persecuted movement would draw many cranks and do-gooders, though on the other hand such a movement might be attractive to adventurers who valued danger, conspiracy, or violence for their own sake. again, when a movement is fully absorbed in a hard struggle (legal or not) for a single, specific, clearly defined goal, one imagines it would attract few individuals who were not willing to commit themselves whole-heartedly to that goal. whether this is true or not, it does seem true that even if many persons having varied and diffuse goals enter a movement, the movement's objective does not necessarily become blurred or perverted if that objective is simple, concrete, and clear, and if the movement is committed to it exclusively. for example, it appears that most of the early feminist leaders were professional reformers who were interested in a variety of causes, such as temperance (anti-alcohol), peace (anti-war), pacifism, abolition of slavery, and so-called ""progressive"" causes generally. yet, once the feminist movement had become clearly focused by about 1870 on the single, overriding goal of woman suffrage, it seems to have remained entirely faithful to that goal until the goal was achieved in the 1920s. thus, the words ""tends to"" and ""may"" that appear in the statement of postulate 3 signify that the postulate does not state an inviolable law, but only a danger to which social movements are subject. the danger, however, is a serious one. postulate 4. the meaning of postulate 4 needs to be clarified: a movement will not necessarily be thoroughly corrupted unless it becomes so powerful that (i) membership in the movement entails little or no risk (whether of physical harm or of other negative consequences, such as drastic loss of social status); and (ii) the movement is able to offer its adherents such conventional satisfactions as money, security, positions of power, a career, or social status-meaning social status not merely within the movement but in society at large. even then the movement's ideals may retain some residual effectiveness unless and until the movement achieves a secure position as the dominant force in society, after which corruption becomes complete. subject to the foregoing clarification, postulate 4 seems to be invariably true. people who join a radical movement while it is still relatively weak may have goals that diverge from those of the movement, but at least such people are not likely to be selfish",27.8

'so many young people get into drinking and drugs early on,' troy says. celia sanchez, who had been a revolutionary guerrillera in cuba, reminisced in 1965 about the dangers and hardships she had gone through with fidel castro's band in the sierra maestra: ""ah, but those were the best times, weren't they? we were all so very happy then. really. we will never be so happy again, will we? never .. . . "" i n an otherwise rather maudlin article, an american veteran of the iraq war conceded that his return to civilian life had its drawbacks: ""i miss that daily sense of purpose, survive or die, that simply can't be replicated in everyday existence."" 8. the purpose of the foregoing examples is not to glorify danger, suffering, or warfare. their purpose is to show that people-even the members of modern technological society, who in normal times are oriented primarily toward security and comfort-will not necessarily choose the easiest road, or the one that seems least dangerous in the short term, when their society is in turmoil, when they are desperate, angry, or horrified at the turn that events are taking, or when it no longer seems possible to maintain their habitual pattern ofliving. under such circumstances many will choose a heroic course of action, even a course that subjects themselves and their loved ones to the greatest risks and hardships . . . if only there are leaders who can energize them, organize them, and give them a sense of purpose. it will be the task of revolutionaries to provide that kind ofleadership when the system arrives at a crisis. at such a time, if the revolutionaries have done and continue to do their work well, they should be able to attract wide support in spite of all the risks and hardships that the revolutionary program entails. this is not to say that the revolutionaries will succeed in winning the support of a majority of the population. it's much more likely that they will be able to organize and lead only a fairly small minority. but ""it is not always the physical majority that is decisive; rather, it is superiority of moral force that tips the political balance."" (simon bolivar). in the event of a sufficiently serious failure of the existing social order the vast majority of the population will lose all respect for it and all confidence in it, hence will make no effective effort to defend it. alinsky stated the case very clearly when he wrote that the ""time is . . . ripe for revolution"" when masses of our people have reached the point of disillusionment with past ways and values. they don't know what will work but they do know that the prevailing system is self-defeating, frustrating, and hopeless. they won't act for change but won't strongly oppose those who do. under these circumstance a great many people will have become hopeless, apathetic, and passive, while most of the rest will be concerned only to save their own skins and those of their loved ones. it is to be expected that the existing power-structure will be in disarray, disoriented, and riven by internal conflict, so that it will do a poor job of organizing and leading any small minority that may still be motivated to defend the system. if, therefore, the revolutionaries act effectively to inspire, organize, and lead their own minority, they will hold the decisive share of power. 9. a failure of the existing social order may not always be needed to provide revolutionaries with an opportunity. it's not clear that there was any grave failure of the social order in ireland prior to the revolution of 1916-1922; certainly the british authorities against whom the revolution was directed were by no means in disarray or otherwise weak. yet the revolution did occur. ordinarily, however, an opportunity for revolution depends on some serious failure of the existing social order. the reformation was possible only because the corruption of the catholic church led many people to lose their respect for it. the revolutions of the early 19th century that won independence for spain's american colonies probably would not have occurred if the weakness of the spanish monarchy had not been demonstrated through its defeat by napoleon and in other ways. the chinese revolution of 1911 was largely a result of the repeated humiliations inflicted on china by the western powers and japan, against which the manchu (or qing, ch'ing) dynasty was unable to defend itself. the russian revolutionaries were given their opportunity by the ignominious military defeats of the tsarist regime in world war i. in germany, the nazis were a minor party up to the onset of the great depression; hitler was able to seize power only because the german government was weak and unable to deal with the economic crisis. in each of the foregoing examples there undoubtedly was a broadly generalized loss of respect for the prevailing social order, and in the last two cases it is probably safe to say that there was widespread anger and desperation on the part of some people, hopelessness on the part of others. in today's world a prerequisite for revolution most likely will be a situation of the latter type, involving widespread anger, desperation, and hopelessness. revolutionaries need to be capable of making use of such a situation. to illustrate with a hypothetical example, let's suppose that i n the coming decades the replacement of human workers by increasingly advanced technology will lead to severe, chronic unemployment throughout the technologically developed part of the world. this will not necessarily produce a crisis serious enough to endanger the existence of the system, for people will tend to react to chronic unemployment with apathy, passivity, and hopelessness. there will be anger, too, which may lead to riots like those recently seen in spain and greece, but these poorly organized, largely purposeless outbursts of frustration (really manifestations of hopelessness) accomplished little or nothing. compare this ineffectual rioting with the ""arab spring"" revolution in egypt (2011), in which intelligent leadership harnessed people's anger and made it into a tool for the extraction of major concessions from the power-structure. the egyptian revolution may prove to be a failure in the end, but for present purposes that is irrelevant. the point here is simply that skillful revolutionary leaders can harness people's anger and frustration and turn it to useful purposes. anti-tech revolutionaries, of course, can't be satisfied with extracting concessions from the power-structure; they have to bring it down altogether. if, as we've hypothesized, there is severe, long-lasting unemployment throughout the technologically advanced part of the world, most of those who still have jobs will be frightened and will have lost their respect for the system, but will be motivated only to hold on to their jobs as long as they can. the unemployed will be either apathetic and hopeless, or angry and desperate, or both. if there is widespread rioting it will put the power-structure under stress, but will not seriously threaten its survival. well-prepared revolutionaries, however, should be capable of organization and leadership that will put people's anger and desperation to work, not in mere rioting, but for purposeful action. from our present standpoint the nature of the purposeful action can only be a matter for conjecture, but, just to take a speculative example, the revolutionaries might extract concessions from the power-structure as the egyptians did, with the difference that the concessions would have to go far enough so that they would deeply humiliate the power-structure. this could be expected to break down the morale of the individuals comprising the power-structure and lead to sharp internal divisions and conflicts within the power-structure, throwing it into disarray. once this stage had been reached, the prospects for the overthrow of the power-structure would be excellent. but let's remember that the foregoing scenario represents a purely hypothetical route to revolution that we've offered only for illustrative purposes. revolution may take a very different route in reality. 10. it is important to",22.73

we give there consist of (formal or informal) organizations of human beings, but self-prop systems that challenge the global self-prop systems also appear at the biological level. thus there are invasive species-plants or animals that multiply uncontrollably in new environments-and new infectious diseases (e.g., aids and lyme disease) that arise more rapidly than means for curing or preventing them can be found. in addition, older varieties of disease-causing bacteria that once seemed well under control have evolved new forms that are resistant to antibiotics, so that the corresponding diseases are difficult or impossible to cure. but in the long run these self-prop systems will probably b e less dangerous to the global self-prop systems than will those biological self-prop systems that have been intentionally or unintentionally created or altered through direct human action, e.g., through genetic engineering. one would have to be extraordinarily nai:ve to imagine that organisms created, altered, or manipulated by humans will always remain safely under control, and in fact there already have been cases in which such organisms have not remained under control, including cases in which organisms have escaped from research facilities. such escaped organisms have the potential to do serious harm. for example, the so-called ""killer bees"" are a hybrid of european and african bees that escaped from a research facility in brazil. since then they have spread over much of south america and into the united states, and they have killed hundreds of people. it's true that, to date, none of these biological self-prop systems has come close to threatening the survival of any of the dominant global self-prop systems, but present-day biotechnology is still in its infancy in comparison with what we can expect for the coming decades. as human interventions in biology reach further and further, the risk of disastrous consequences continually rises, and as long as the technological equipment needed for such interventions exists, there are no practicable means of controlling this risk. small groups of amateurs are already dabbling in genetic engineering. these amateurs wouldn't have to create synthetic life or do anything highly sophisticated in order to bring on a disaster; merely changing a few genes in an existing organism could have catastrophic consequences. the chances of disaster in any one instance may be remote, but there are potentially thousands or millions of amateurs who could begin monkeying with the genes of microorganisms, and thousands or millions of minute risks can add up to a very substantial risk. some people think it may become possible in the future to create microscopic (""nanotechnological""), non-biological self-prop systems that could reproduce themselves uncontrollably, with deadly consequences for the whole world. others claim that (macroscopic) self-reproducing robots will probably be built, and even the rabid technophile ray kurzweil admits that such machines will evolve beyond the control of human beings. this writer does not have the technical expertise to judge whether such speculations are plausible or whether they should be dismissed as science fiction. yet, today's science fiction often turns out to be tomorrow's fact. because of their ability to reproduce themselves by the billions in a short time, microscopic self-prop systems, biological or not, may prove to be especially dangerous to the global self-prop systems. on the other hand, human self-prop systems may turn out to be more dangerous after all, not only because they are intelligent, but also because they exist as subsystems of the global self-prop systems and therefore can potentially impair the integrity of the latter. but this line of inquiry is leading us too far into speculation, so we'll drop it here. e. in part ii of chapter two we've argued that when only relatively few individuals are available from among which to select the ""fittest"" (in the darwinian sense), the process of natural selection will be inefficient in producing self-propagating systems that are fit for survival. we illustrate with an example. the inefficiency of government agencies or enterprises, in comparison with private enterprises, is notorious, and the reason is clear: natural selection is not operative among the agencies or enterprises of a given government. if a government-owned or government-controlled agency or enterprise is inefficient-even grossly inefficient-the government tries to reform it in some way, or simply gives it enough money to keep it from collapsing. rarely indeed will a government allow such an agency or enterprise to die a natural death. in contrast, private enterprises that become inefficient are (barring government interference) eliminated by natural selection. it seems safe to say that among private enterprises-just as among biological organisms-natural selection leads to the evolution of sophisticated mechanisms that promote the vigor of such enterprises-including mechanisms that are too complex or subtle to be understood, controlled, or even recognized by human beings. students of business administration do of course understand many of the mechanisms at work in successful enterprises. clearly, however, they are far from a complete understanding of all such mechanisms, for if the principles underlying the efficient functioning of private enterprises were fully understood, then government agencies or enterprises could be made equally efficient by applying to them the same principles. government agencies and enterprises do try to apply the known principles of business administration, but they nevertheless remain far less efficient than private enterprises-because a great deal of what makes an enterprise efficient remains unknown to, or beyond the control of, human beings. however, even i f natural selection is inoperative among the agencies or enterprises belonging to a given government, natural selection does operate on governments and on the nations they govern. for example, when the countries of the communist bloc failed to compete successfully with the west, their governments and their economic systems were radically transformed in imitation of western governments and economic systems. the soviet union broke apart, and from its fragments new nations under new governments were born. so why doesn't natural selection make national governments, including governmental agencies and enterprises, equal to private enterprises in vigor and efficiency? in any capitalist system there are many thousands of business enterprises. new enterprises are continually being formed, while some older enterprises go bankrupt, or are absorbed by more powerful enterprises, or are split into two or more separate enterprises. thus, ample scope for evolution through natural selection is provided by the number of business enterprises and the fluidity with which such enterprises are formed or eliminated. but there are only about two hundred sovereign nations in the world. the creation of new nations and the demise of old ones are infrequent events. likewise infrequent is the replacement of a nation's government by a new government of a different type. thus, among nations and their governments, there is only relatively limited scope for evolution through natural selection, and this, we think, explains why governments, with their agencies and enterprises, have not evolved to the same level of efficiency as private enterprises have. f. one of the most serious mistakes that people make in thinking about the development of societies is to assume that human beings make collective decisions of their own free will and can impose those decisions on their society, as if human volition were something existing outside of the organizational structures of society and capable of acting independently of those structures. in reality, human volition is to a very significant extent a product of the organizational structures of society, for one of the most important factors that determine the success of an organization is its capacity for people-management; that is, its ability to induce people to think and act in ways that serve the needs of the organization. some techniques of people-management may be described as ""external,"" meaning that they are used to influence the thought and behavior of people who are not members of the organization that applies the techniques. external techniques include, among others, those of propaganda and public relations. propaganda and public relations techniques can also be applied internally, to manage the behavior of the members of the organization that applies the techniques; and other techniques are designed specifically for internal use. business schools give courses in a subject called ""organizational behavior,"" which is, in part, the study of techniques through which an organization can manage the behavior of its own members. also important are techniques for selecting individuals who are suited to become members of a given organization. but we maintain that the people-managing capability of organizations is not limited to techniques, that is, to methods understood and consciously applied by human beings. we argue that through natural selection organizations evolve mechanisms not recognized or understood by human beings that tend to induce people to act in ways that serve the needs of the organization. this ties in with what we argued in part e of this appendix, about the operation of natural selection among business enterprises. of course, all these conscious and unconscious mechanisms put together are very far from

(however, many of the people we are referring to as ""leftists"" do not think of themselves as leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs as leftism. we use the term ""leftism"" because we don't know of any better word to designate the spectrum of related creeds that includes the feminist, gay rights, political correctness, etc., movements, and because these movements have a strong affinity with the old left. see paragraphs 227-230.) 219. leftism is totalitarian force. wherever leftism is in a position of power it tends to invade every private corner and force every thought into a leftist mold. in part this is because of the quasi-religious character of leftism: everything contrary to leftist beliefs represents sin. more importantly, leftism is a totalitarian force because of the leftists' drive for power. the leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement, and he tries to go through the power process by helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83). but no matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate activity (see paragraph 41). that is, the leftist's real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is motivated by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal. consequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has already attained; his need for the power process leads him always to pursue some new goal.lhe leftist wants equal opportunities for minorities. when that is attained he insists on statistical equality of achievement by minorities. and as long as anyone harbors in some corner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minority, the leftist has to re-educate him. and ethnic minorities are not enough; no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward homosexuals, disabled people, fat people, old people, ugly people, and on and on and on. it's not enough that the public should be informed about the hazards of smoking; a warning has to be stamped on every package of cigarettes. then cigarette advertising has to be restricted if not banned. the activists will never be satisfied until tobacco is outlawed, and after that it will be alcohol, then junk food, etc. activists have fought gross child abuse, which is reasonable. but now they want to stop all spanking. when they have done that they will want to ban something else they consider unwholesome, then another thing and then another. they will never be satisfied until they have complete control over all child-rearing practices. and then they will move on to another cause. 220. suppose you asked leftists to make a list of all the things that were wrong with society, and then suppose you instituted every social change that they demanded. it is safe to say that within a couple of years the majority of leftists would find something new to complain about, some new social ""evil"" to correct; because, once again, the leftist is motivated less by distress at society's ills than by the need to satisfy his drive for power by imposing his solutions on society. 221. because of the restrictions placed on their thought and behavior by their high level of socialization, many leftists of the oversocialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do. for them the drive for power has only one morally acceptable outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on everyone. 222. lef tists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are true believers in the sense of eric hoffer s book, the true believer. but not all true believers are of the same psychological type as leftists. presumably a true-believing nazi, for instance, is very different psychologically from a true-believing leftist. because of their capacity for single-minded devotion to a cause, true believers are a useful, perhaps a necessary, ingredient of any revolutionary movement. this presents a problem with which we must admit we don't know how to deal. we aren't sure how to harness the energies of the true believer to a revolution against technology. at present all we can say is that no true believer will make a safe recruit to the revolution unless his commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology. if he is committed also to another ideal, he may want to use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal. (see paragraphs 200, 201.) 223. some readers may say, ""this stuff about leftism is a lot of crap. i know john and jane who are leftish types and they don't have all these totalitarian tendencies. ""it's quite true that many leftists, possibly even a numerical majority, are decent people who sincerely believe in tolerating others'values (up to a point) and wouldn't want to use high-handed methods to reach their social goals. our remarks about leftism are not meant to apply to every individual leftist but to describe the general character of leftism as a movement. and the general character of a movement is not necessarily determined by the numerical proportions of the various kinds of people involved in the movement. 224. the people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements tend to be leftists of the most power-hungry type, because power-hungry people are those who strive hardest to get into positions of power. once the power-hungry types have captured control of the movement, there are many leftists of a gentler breed who inwardly disapprove of many of the actions of the leaders, but cannot bring themselves to oppose them. they need their faith in the movement, and because they cannot give up this faith they go along with the leaders. true, some leftists do have the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that emerge, but they generally lose, because the power-hungry types are better organized, are more ruthless and machiavellian and have taken care to build themselves a strong power-base. 225. these phenomena appeared clearly in russia and other countries that were taken over by leftists. similarly, before the breakdown of communism in the ussr, leftish types in the west would seldom criticize that country. if prodded they would admit that the ussr did many wrong things, but then they would try to find excuses for the communists and begin talking about the faults of the west. they always opposed western military resistance to communist aggression. leftish types all over the world vigorously protested the u.s. military action in vietnam, but when the ussr invaded afghanistan they did nothing. not that they approved of the soviet actions; but, because of their leftist faith, they just couldn't bear to put themselves in opposition to communism. today, in those of our universities where ""political correctness"" has become dominant, there are probably many leftish types who privately disapprove of the suppression of academic freedom, but they go along with it anyway. 226. thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a whole from having a totalitarian tendency. 227. our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. it is still far from clear what we mean by the word ""leftist.""there doesn't seem to be much we can do about this. today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of activist movements. yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements (e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with leftists. varieties of leftists fade out gradually into varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed to decide whether a given individual is or is not a leftist. to the extent that it is defined at all, our conception of leftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article, and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in deciding who is a leftist. 228. but it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism.",22.07

(the foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man.) people have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessarily frustrated in modern life, hence fall into group 3. one may become angry, but modern society cannot permit fighting. in many situations it does not even permit verbal aggression. when going somewhere one may be in a hurry, or one may be in a mood to travel slowly, but one generally has no choice but to move with the flow of traffic and obey the traffic signals. one may want to do one’s work in a different way, but usually one can work only according to the rules laid down by one’s employer. in many other ways as well, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations (explicit or implicit) that frustrate many of his impulses and thus interfere with the power process. most of these regulations cannot be dispensed with, because they are necessary for the functioning of industrial society. modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive. in matters that are irrelevant to the functioning of the system we can generally do what we please. we can believe in any religion (as long as it does not encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system). we can go to bed with anyone we like (as long as we practice “safe sex”). we can do anything we like as long as it is unimportant. but in all important matters the system tends increasingly to regulate our behavior. behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the government. control is often exercised through indirect coercion or through psychological pressure or manipulation, and by organizations other than the government, or by the system as a whole. most large organizations use some form of propaganda to manipulate public attitudes or behavior. propaganda is not limited to “commercials” and advertisements, and sometimes it is not even consciously intended as propaganda by the people who make it. for instance, the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of propaganda. an example of indirect coercion: there is no law that says we have to go to work every day and follow our employer’s orders. legally there is nothing to prevent us from going to live in the wild like primitive people or from going into business for ourselves. but in practice there is very little wild country left, and there is room in the economy for only a limited number of small business owners. hence most of us can survive only as someone else’s employee. we suggest that modern man’s obsession with longevity, and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process. the “mid-life crisis” also is such a symptom. so is the lack of interest in having children that is fairly common in modern society but almost unheard-of in primitive societies. in primitive societies life is a succession of stages. the needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. a young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food. (in young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won’t discuss that here.) this phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (in contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of “fulfillment.” we suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process -- with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) again, having successfully raised his children, going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. any modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. we argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. it is not the primitive man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. it is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life. in response to the arguments of this section someone will say, “society must find a way to give people the opportunity to go through the power process.” for such people the value of the opportunity is destroyed by the very fact that society gives it to them. what they need is to find or make their own opportunities. as long as the system gives them their opportunities it still has them on a leash. to attain autonomy they must get off that leash. not everyone in industrial-technological society suffers from psychological problems. some people even profess to be quite satisfied with society as it is. we now discuss some of the reasons why people differ so greatly in their response to modern society. first, there doubtless are differences in the strength of the drive for power. individuals with a weak drive for power may have relatively little need to go through the power process, or at least relatively little need for autonomy in the power process. these are docile types who would have been happy as plantation darkies in the old south. (we don’t mean to sneer at the “plantation darkies” of the old south. to their credit, most of the slaves were not content with their servitude. we do sneer at people who are content with servitude.) some people may have some exceptional drive, in pursuing which they satisfy their need for the power process. for example, those who have an unusually strong drive for social status may spend their whole lives climbing the",21.74

""beliefs that are potentially revolutionary may exist temporally long before strain arises to activate these beliefs as determinants of a value-oriented movement; revolutionary organizations may lie in wait for conditions of conduciveness, upon which they then capitalize."" in 1847 karl marx and friedrich engels were just a couple of eccentrics who prepared the communist manifesto for an obscure group called the communist league, which had only a few hundred members and soon dissolved. in ireland, nationalist ideas were kept alive for several decades only by a minuscule minority of extremists who had very little support among the general population until the uprising of april 1916 reactivated the revolutionary process. fidel castro said, ""i began a revolution with eighty-two men. if i had to do it again, i would do it with ten or fifteen and absolute faith."" castro actually started his revolution with only about a dozen men, because three days after he landed in cuba with his eighty-two they were attacked by the forces of the dictator, batista; nearly all were killed or captured, and no more than twelve, or possibly fifteen, were left to carry on the struggle in the sierra maestra. even at its peak two years later the guerrilla band amounted to only about 800 men, as against batista's army of 30,000. yet castro won. such a victory of course could not be a purely military one, nor was it achieved by castro's guerrilleros alone. castro's victory was primarily a political one, and was possible only because the cuban people had no respect for or confidence in the batista regime. the dictator was politically incompetent and unable to retain the loyalty even of his own army, which proved itself decidedly reluctant to fight the rebels. and batista was really overthrown by a coalition of forces, of which castro's guerrilla band was not the only important component. what enabled castro to prevail over the other elements of the coalition and emerge as master of cuba was his skill as a politician, propagandist, and organizer. while his military action played an indispensable role, it did s o mainly through its political and psychological effect. the point to be emphasized here, though, is that when castro, leading his tiny band of a dozen men, looked up at the sierra maestra and said, ""now batista will be defeated!,"" most people would have thought him mad. yet batista was indeed defeated and castro did take control of cuba. in russia at the beginning of the 20th century the revolutionaries comprised an insignificant minority and were regarded as ""cranks."" the russian social democratic labor party, of which the bolsheviks formed a part, consisted of only a few hundred individuals. according to lenin: prior to january 22 . . . 1905, the revolutionary party of russia consisted of a small handful of people, and the reformists of those days .. . derisively called us a 'sect' . . . . within a few months, however, the picture completely changed. the hundreds of revolutionary social democrats 'suddenly' grew into thousands; the thousands became leaders of between two and three million proletarians . . . . the 1905 revolution was a failure, but it did help prepare the way for the successful revolution of 1917. up to the latter year, nevertheless, the bolsheviks remained weak. at the outbreak of world war i in 1914, three of the seven members of their st. petersburg committee were police spies, and soon afterward the bolsheviks' centralized organization was destroyed by the arrest of their delegates in the duma (the russian parliament). on the very eve of the opening episode of the 1917 revolution the bolshevik leaders were scattered in exile, and no one (except possibly the police) paid any attention to them. but less than a year later they had made themselves masters of the vast russian empire-something like one-sixth of the world's land surface. the bolsheviks had prepared themselves long in advance of the outbreak of the revolution. they had built a cohesive cadre of professional revolutionists who were disciplined, purposeful, strongly motivated, well led, and reasonably unified. the bolsheviks were effective organizers, and, because they understood better than anyone else the dynamics of social movements, they formulated policies that proved to be successful. their chief rivals, the far more numerous social revolutionaries, were deficient in these qualities. ""[w]hereas the agitation of the mensheviks and social revolutionaries was scattered, self-contradictory and oftenest of all evasive, the agitation of the bolsheviks was distinguished by its concentrated and well thought-out character."" trotsky describes how, in one county, three or four bolsheviks were sufficient to prevail over the much larger but relatively timid social revolutionary organization. ""the lack of correspondence between the technical resources of the bolsheviks and their relative political weight [found] its expression in the small number of members of the party compared to the colossal growth of its influence."" meanwhile, the ""bourgeois-democratic"" reformists (kerensky et al.) were not even in the running, because they lacked unity and concentrated purpose and seem to have had no conception of what was and what was not possible in a time of passionate upheaval such as that which gripped russia in 1917. as for the defenders of the old tsarist order, to the extent that there were any left in russia they were in total disarray and psychologically defeated. consequently, the bolsheviks were able to overwhelm all their adversaries and make themselves the dominant political force in russia. all this doesn't necessarily mean that the bolsheviks had the support-much less the active support-of a majority of russians. the support of the peasants was shaky at best, and existed only when the bolsheviks were (temporarily) giving them what they wanted. but once the bolsheviks had seized power in october68 1917, the only organized and efftctive resistance to them originated outside russia with the numerous emigres who opposed the revolution. these assembled counterrevolutionary armies and, supported by several foreign powers, invaded russia with the intention of ousting the bolsheviks. during the ensuing civil war of 1918-1920: ""the rate of desertions in the red army was unusually high: trotsky instituted a veritable reign of terror to prevent defections, including placing in the rear of the troops machine-gun detachments with instructions to shoot retreating units.""69 but obviously the bolsheviks couldn't have maintained their control over a disaffected majority without the loyal support of at least a substantial minority; those machine-gunners wouldn't have been willing to shoot down their fellow soldiers on orders from trotsky if they hadn't been committed to the bolshevik cause. the bolsheviks moreover had their minority well organized and disciplined; consequently they prevailed over the invaders, who were not so well organized. it's important to notice that the crucial events of the russian revolution took place in st. petersburg. this was true of the spontaneous insurrection of february 1917 and also of the bolsheviks' seizure of power the following october. thus the bolsheviks were able to concentrate their efforts on a single city; once they had won i n st. petersburg the rest of the country was relatively easy. this shows how victory at the single most critical point can provide a basis for the assumption of power throughout an entire society-a further reason why it is possible for a numerically small revolutionary movement to prevail. 11. to summarize, the expected pattern for a revolution against the technological system will be something like the following: a. a small movement, a cohesive cadre of committed, hard-core revolutionaries, will build its internal strength by developing its own organization and discipline. this movement should have branches in several of the world's most important nations or groups of nations; say, the united states, china, western europe, and one or more of russia, latin america, and india. in each country, the movement will prepare the way for revolution by disseminating ideas-ideas that will be chosen for their soundness and not for their popularity. the movement will take pains to demonstrate the most uncompromising revolutionary integrity, and will strive to prove itself the most effective of all the factions opposed to the existing system. b. a large minority of the general population will recognize that the revolutionaries' ideas have some merit. but this minority will reject the revolutionaries' solutions, if only through reluctance to change familiar ways of living or as a result of cowardice or apathy. c. eventually there will arrive a crisis, or a failure of the system serious enough to enable the revolutionaries to create a crisis, in which it will no longer be possible to carry on with familiar ways of living, and in which the system's ability to provide for people's physical and psychological needs will be impaired to such an extent that most people will lose all respect",23.45

""the history ofliberation heroes shows that when they come into office they interact with powerful groups: they can easily forget that they've been put in power by the poorest of the poor. they often lose their common touch, and turn against their own people."" (nelson mandela) look at history: we know very well what happened to christianity after the church became powerful. it seems that the corruption of the clergy has usually been in direct proportion to the power of the church at any given time. some of the popes have actually been depraved. islam didn't turn out any better. twenty-four years after the prophet's death his son-in-law, the caliph uthman ibn affan, was killed by rebels, and this event was followed by power-struggles and violence among the muslims and a prolonged period of conflict within islam. nor does the later history of lslam indicate that it adhered to its ideals any better than christianity did. the french revolution was followed by the dictatorship of napoleon, the russian revolution by that of stalin. after the mexican revolution of 1910-1920, the revolutionary ideals were progressively drained of their content until mexico found itself under the dictatorship of a party that continued to call itself ""revolutionary"" without being so in reality. the sociologist eric hoffer wrote: hitler, who had a clear vision of the whole course of a movement even while he was nursing his infant national socialism, warned that a movement retains its vigor only so long as it can offer nothing in the present . . .. according to hitler, the more 'posts and offices a movement has to hand out, the more inferior stuff it will attract, and in the end these political hangers-on overwhelm a successful party in such number that the honest fighter of former days no longer recognizes the old movement . . .. when this happens, the ""mission"" of such a movement is done for.' in march 1949, when the communists were on the verge of final victory in china, mao warned: with victory, certain moods may grow within the party-arrogance, the airs of a self-styled hero, inertia and unwillingness to make progress, love of pleasure and distaste for continued hard living .. .. the comrades must be helped to remain modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and rashness in their style of work. the comrades must be helped to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle. needless to say, mao's warning was futile. already in 1957 he complained: a dangerous tendency has shown itself of late among many of our personnel-an unwillingness to share the joys and hardships of the masses, a concern for personal fame and gain. today the communist regime in china is notorious for its corruption: not only are party members and government officials concerned more with their own careers than they are with communist ideals; what is worse, the regime is pervaded by out-and-out criminal dishonesty. shortly before the end of the american war of independence, thomas jefferson wrote: it can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest and ourselves united. from the conclusion of this war, we shall be going downhill. in fact, soon after the end of the war, quarreling and disunity broke out among the thirteen states to such an extent that the new nation seemed on the point of breaking up. by creating the constitution of 1787 the revolutionaries succeeded in saving the union, but the passage in 1798 of the anti-libertarian alien and sedition acts suggests a weakening of commitment to the ideals of the revolution even among some of the old revolutionaries, and by the time most of the original revolutionaries were dead not much idealism, or even integrity, seems to have been left in american politics. one has to ask why the united states did not go the way of most latin american countries and fall under the control of a dictator or an oligarchy. one part of any answer to this question should be that before the revolution the american colonists, like their english cousins, had already been long habituated to a semi-democratic form of government, hence would not have been likely to create or tolerate a highly authoritarian regime. iii. examination of the rules because the rules are directly derived from the postulates, our discussion of the rules is in some ways merely an extension or elaboration of the foregoing discussion of the postulates. rule (i) asserts that a movement needs a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective. the story of the so-called civil society movement in mexico shows what typically happens to a movement that flagrantly violates rule (i). the civil society movement originated in 1985, and its goals were to oppose ""concentrated, centralized power"" and to fight ""for human rights, civil rights, political reform and social justice against the domination of the one-party state.""46 thus the movement favored decentralization and ""a redistribution of power,"" and ""tended to take the side of the underdog, to side with peasants and workers, poor people and indians."" obviously the civil society movement did not have a single, clear, concrete goal. some sectors of the movement did adopt single, clear, concrete goals. for example, the mexican anti-nuclear movement was part of the civil society movement, and its single goal was to prevent the development of nuclear energy in mexico. it was not completely successful in achieving this, since one nuclear power-plant was put into operation in mexico. however, ""the anti-nuclear movement had really won on the question of mexico's nuclear future,"" because mexico's ruling party ""abandoned its ambitious plans for a dozen or more nuclear reactors."" but who hears of the civil society movement today (in 2013), twentyeight years after it arose? the movement seems to have petered out without having made any significant progress toward the general goals stated above. the election in 2000 as president of mexico of vicente fox of the ""conservative"" (read ""authoritarian"") pan party may have seemed to end the ""domination of the one-party state"" by breaking the pri party's monopoly of power, but many of the pri technocrats had actually wanted ""some sort of power-sharing arrangement with the pan,"" so that mexico would no longer appear to be a one-party state yet would remain effectively under technocratic control. the technocrats' power-sharing arrangement seems to be working out very nicely: the pan held the presidency for two six-year terms (2000-2012), and the pri is now (2013) back in power. it could be said that there has been a ""redistribution of power"" in mexico; as of 2008-2010: in much of the country [drug gangs are] more powerful than the government itself. mexico's three main drug cartels are effectively in control of the country's pacific coast, industrial heartland, and tourist havens of the gulf coast . . . . [t]he gangs . . . don't hesitate to kill the politicians, cops, and journalists they can't bribe or intimidate . . . . yet they are folk heroes to many poor mexicans . . . . [the gangs'] ranks now include many members of mexico's elite special forces. at the same time, the gangs have infiltrated much of mexico's power structure . . . .they have corrupted every level of government, from local policemen to army generals to presidential aides. there are indications that mexico's government is now (2013) gaining the upper hand over the drug gangs. but even if the gangs were to retain their power indefinitely, that would hardly be the kind of ""redistribution of power"" that the initiators of the civil society movement had in mind. thus, while some sectors of the movement may",20.28

""as business became nationwide ... the competition of different manufacturing areas meant that prices and wages were no longer determined by local conditions. they fluctuated as a consequence of economic changes wholly beyond the control of the employers or workers immediately concerned."" a recent (2012) article by adam davidson discusses some of the reasons behind the problem of unemployment in the u.s. taking as an example a company he has personally investigated, davidson writes: ""it's tempting to look to the owners of standard motor products and ask them to help [unskilled workers]: to cut costs a little less relentlessly, take slightly lower profits, and maybe even help solve america's jobs crisis in some small way."" davidson then goes on to explain why a company like standard motor products would not be able to survive in the face of competition if it did not cut costs relentlessly and, therefore, replace human workers with machines whenever it was profitable to do so. here again we see that "" [t]he businessman ... [is] only the agent of economic forces and developments beyond his control."" in the last two examples the options open to leaders of organizations were limited not by technical factors alone, but by these in conjunction with competition from outside the organization. but even independently of external competition and of any ""conflict of wills"" within a system, technical factors by themselves severely limit the choices available to the system's leaders. not even dictators can escape these limitations. in the encyclopaedia britannica article on spain we find: ""for almost 20 years after the [spanish civil war], the [franco regime] followed a policy of ... national economic self-sufficiency ... . spain's policies of economic self-sufficiency were a failure, and by the late 1950s the country was on the verge of economic collapse."" unwilling to rely solely on the foregoing brief passage for twenty years of spanish economic history, this writer consulted a spanish correspondent, who sent him copies of pages from relevant historical works. it turned out that the britannica's account-perhaps unavoidably in view of its brevity-was oversimplified to the point of being seriously misleading. among other things, it isn't clear to what extent spain's policy of self-sufficiency was voluntarily chosen and to what extent it was forced on the country, first by the conditions prevailing during world war ii and later by the western democracies' hostility to the authoritarian regime of franco. much of this history is beyond the understanding of those of us who have no specialized knowledge of economics, but one thing does emerge clearly: quite apart from any external competition or internal conflict, economic reality imposes narrow limits on what even an authoritarian regime can do with a nation's economy. a dictator cannot run an economy the way a general runs an army-by giving orders from above-because the economy won't follow orders. in other words, not even a powerful dictator like francisco franco can overrule the laws of economics. nor can idealistic zeal overcome those laws. in the years following the cuban revolution of 1956 -59, u.s. media propaganda portrayed fidel castro as motivated by a lust for power, but actually castro started out with generalized humanitarian and democratic goals. once he had overthrown the batista government, he found that, despite the immense power conferred on him by his personal charisma, the options open to him were extremely limited. circumstances forced him to choose between democracy and the deep social reforms that he envisioned; he couldn't have both. since his basic goals were his social ones he had to abandon democracy, become a dictator, and stalinize and militarize cuban society. there can be no doubt about the idealistic zeal of the cuban revolutionaries,95 and castro was as powerful as any charismatic dictator could ever be. even so, the revolutionary regime was unable to control the development of cuban society: castro admitted that he had failed to curb the bureaucratic tendencies of cuba's administrative apparatus. notwithstanding the regime's strong ideological opposition to racism, ""the drive to promote ... blacks and mixed race cubans to leadership positions within the government and party"" was only partly successful, as castro himself acknowledged. in fact, cuban efforts to combat racism do not seem to have been any more successful than those of the united states. the castro regime achieved no more than minimal success in its attempt to free the cuban economy from its almost total dependence on sugar and to industrialize the country. to survive at all economically, the regime was forced to abandon its attempt to build ""socialism"" (as conceived by cuba's idealistic leaders) within a short period. it was found necessary instead to make ideologically painful compromises with economic reality, and even with these compromises the cuban economy has remained no more than barely viable. a contributing factor in cuba's economic failure was the embargo imposed by the united states: u.s. firms were forbidden to trade with cuba. but this factor was not decisive, and not as important as admirers of the castro regime liked to think. cuba could trade with most of the economically important countries of the world other than the u.s., and was even able to trade indirectly with major u.s. corporations by dealing with their subsidiaries in other countries. the embargo was far less important than cuba's inability to free itself from its excessive dependence on sugar or even to run its sugar industry efficiently. another factor in cuba's economic failure was a lack of cooperation within cuban society-engels's ""conflicts among many individual wills."" there were absenteeism, passive resistance to production quotas, and ""stolid peasant resistance."" ""individualistic"" tendencies led to pilfering, waste, and even to major criminal activity. in addition, there were conflicts within the cuban power-structure. almost certainly, however, the decisive factor in cuba's failure has been the castro regime's refusal to comply with the technical requirements for economic success: the regime compromised its ideology only as far as was necessary for bare survival, and declined to accept those elements of the free market and of capitalism that might have made vigorous development possible. that this factor was decisive is shown by the fact that purely socialist economies have failed all over the world. iv. there is yet another-and critically important-reason why a society cannot ""steer"" itself in the manner suggested at the beginning of part iii of this chapter: every complex, large-scale society is subject to internal developments generated by ""natural selection"" operating on systems that exist within the society. this factor is discussed at length in chapter two; here we will only sketch the argument in the briefest possible terms. through a process analogous to biological evolution there arise, within any complex, large-scale society, self-preserving or self-reproducing systems large and small (including, for example, business enterprises, political parties or movements, open or covert social networks such as networks of corrupt officials) that struggle to survive and propagate themselves. because power is a cardinal tool for survival, these systems compete for power. biological organisms, evolving through natural selection, eventually invade every niche in which biological survival is possible at all, and, whatever measures may be taken to suppress them, some organisms will find ways of surviving nonetheless. within any complex, large-scale society, a similar process will produce self-propagating systems that will invade every corner and circumvent all attempts to suppress them. these systems will compete for power without regard to the objectives of any government (or other entity) that may try to steer the society. our argument-admittedly impossible at present to prove conclusively-is that these self-propagating systems will constitute uncontrollable forces that will render futile in the long run all efforts to steer the society rationally. for details, see chapter two. v. notwithstanding all the arguments we've reviewed in the present chapter up to this point, let's make the unrealistic assumption that techniques for manipulating the internal dynamics of a society will some day be developed to such a degree that a single, all-powerful leader (we'll be charitable and call him a philosopher-king rather than a dictator)-or a group of leaders small enough (< 6?) to be free of ""conflicts among individual wills"" within the group-will be able to steer a society as suggested at the beginning of part iii, above. the notion of authoritarian rule by a single leader or a small group of leaders is not as",26.79

[t]he change in social behavior is so long term and so widespread as to suggest a connection with the most fundamental of contemporary social processes; that of industrial urbanization itself....”massachusetts in 1835 had a population of some 660,940, 81 percent rural, overwhelmingly pre-industrial and native born. it’s citizens were used to considerable personal freedom. whether teamsters, farmers or artisans, they were all accustomed to setting their own schedules, and the nature of their work made them physically independent of each other.... individual problems, sins or even crimes, were not generally cause for wider social concern....” but the impact of the twin movements to the city and to the factory, both just gathering force in 1835, had a progressive effect on personal behavior throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. the factory demanded regularity of behavior, a life governed by obedience to the rhythms of clock and calendar, the demands of foreman and supervisor. in the city or town, the needs of living in closely packed neighborhoods inhibited many actions previously unobjectionable. both blue- and white-collar employees in larger establishments were mutually dependent on their fellows; as one man’s work fit into anther’s, so one man’s business was no longer his own. “the results of the new organization of life and work were apparent by 1900, when some 76 percent of the 2,805,346 inhabitants of massachusetts were classified as urbanites. much violent or irregular behavior which had been tolerable in a casual, independent society was no longer acceptable in the more formalized, cooperative atmosphere of the later period.... the move to the cities had, in short, produced a more tractable, more socialized, more ‘civilized’ generation than its predecessors.” if copyright problems make it impossible for this long quotation to be printed, then please change note 16 to read as follows: when the american colonies were under british rule there were fewer and less effective legal guarantees of freedom than there were after the american constitution went into effect, yet there was more personal freedom in preindustrial america, both before and after the war of independence, than there was after the industrial revolution took hold in this country. in “violence in america: historical and comparative perspectives,” edited by hugh davis graham and ted robert gurr, chapter 12 by roger lane, it is explained how in pre-industrial america the average person had greater independence and autonomy than he does today, and how the process of industrialization necessarily led to the restriction of personal freedom. apologists for the system are fond of citing cases in which elections have been decided by one or two votes, but such cases are rare. “today, in technologically advanced lands, men live very similar lives in spite of geographical, religious, and political differences. the daily lives of a christian bank clerk in chicago, a buddhist bank clerk in tokyo, and a communist bank clerk in moscow are far more alike than the life of any one of them is like that of any single man who lived a thousand years ago. these similarities are the result of a common technology....” l. sprague de camp, “the ancient engineers,” ballantine edition, page 17. the lives of the three bank clerks are not identical. ideology does have some effect. but all technological societies, in order to survive, must evolve along approximately the same trajectory. just think an irresponsible genetic engineer might create a lot of terrorists. for a further example of undesirable consequences of medical progress, suppose a reliable cure for cancer is discovered. even if the treatment is too expensive to be available to any but the elite, it will greatly reduce their incentive to stop the escape of carcinogens into the environment. since many people may find paradoxical the notion that a large number of good things can add up to a bad thing, we illustrate with an analogy. suppose mr. a is playing chess with mr. b. mr. c, a grand master, is looking over mr. a’s shoulder. mr. a of course wants to win his game, so if mr. c points out a good move for him to make, he is doing mr. a a favor. but suppose now that mr. c tells mr. a how to make all of his moves. in each particular instance he does mr. a a favor by showing him his best move, but by making all of his moves for him he spoils his game, since there is not point in mr. a’s playing the game at all if someone else makes all his moves. the situation of modern man is analogous to that of mr. a. the system makes an individual’s life easier for him in innumerable ways, but in doing so it deprives him of control over his own fate. here we are considering only the conflict of values within the mainstream. for the sake of simplicity we leave out of the picture “outsider” values like the idea that wild nature is more important than human economic welfare. self-interest is not necessarily material self-interest. it can consist in fulfillment of some psychological need, for example, by promoting one’s own ideology or religion. a qualification: it is in the interest of the system to permit a certain prescribed degree of freedom in some areas. for example, economic freedom (with suitable limitations and restraints) has proved effective in promoting economic growth. but only planned, circumscribed, limited freedom is in the interest of the system. the individual must always be kept on a leash, even if the leash is sometimes long (see paragraphs 94, 97). we don’t mean to suggest that the efficiency or the potential for survival of a society has always been inversely proportional to the amount of pressure or discomfort to which the society subjects people. that certainly is not the case. there is good reason to believe that many primitive societies subjected people to less pressure than european society did, but european society proved far more efficient than any primitive society and always won out in conflicts with such societies because of the advantages conferred by technology. if you think that",28.3

if anything, primitives are probably braver on an individual basis than europeans are. the superiority of european troops can best be attributed to (unidentified) cultural mechanisms evolved through natural selection in the course of millennia, during which european history has been characterized by constant warfare. of course, there has always been warfare among primitives, too, but such warfare has typically been carried on primarily through guerrilla-like raids rather than pitched battles. so it's not surprising that primitives tend to make excellent guerrilla fighters but are rarely able to put together a regular army capable of facing europeans on equal terms. societies at an early stage of civilization, like those of the aztecs and incas, ordinarily have had extensive experience of pitched battles, but perhaps have not been subjected to selection through that type of warfare for the same length of time or at the same level of intensity as european societies have; and this may be the reason why their armies have been unable to stand up against european ones. the fighting qualities of soldiers could be argued ad infinitum, but our interest here is not in fighting qualities per se (nor do we mean to make any value judgment about such qualities). our purpose at the moment is only to illustrate the point that human organizations evolve, through natural selection, mechanisms that favor their survival and expansion, including mechanisms that are not understood or recognized by human beings. g. in commenting on an earlier, less complete exposition of the theory developed in chapter two of this book, dr. skrbina observed that a small, isolated island might be considered analogous, for the purposes of the theory, to the earth as a whole, and he raised by implication the question of whether a counterexample to the theory might be found on a small island without human inhabitants. a proper discussion of this question would require a good knowledge of the biology of small, isolated islands, which this writer does not have. let's merely take note of the fact that the smaller the island, the less biodiversity it has. this perhaps makes it doubtful whether the ecosystem of such an island could be ""highly complex"" (as students of industrial accidents use that term); or whether it could be ""rich"" enough so that (under proposition 1 of chapter two) new self-propagating systems would continually arise to challenge the dominant ones. so much for islands without human inhabitants. it may be worthwhile, however, to glance briefly at small, isolated islands occupied by humans at a primitive technological level, of which jared diamond provides us with two relevant examples: easter island and tikopia. easter island certainly offers no counterexample to our theory, since its inhabitants did indeed devastate it as far as was possible with the limited technology at their disposal. tikopia, on the other hand, merits a closer look. tikopia is so tiny (1.8 square miles) that a good runner could doubtless go from one end of the island to the other in somewhere between ten minutes and an hour, depending on the shape of the island, the nature of the terrain, and the straightness or crookedness of the footpaths. thus, sufficiently rapid transportation and communication were possible between any two parts of tikopia, and self-prop systems spanning the entire island-analogous to the global self-prop systems considered in chapter two-could have developed. it's impossible to know whether such self-prop systems did in fact develop on tikopia in the remote past. what we do know is that in the course of their first 800 years on the island the original settlers did devastate tikopia ecologically, but-probably because they had no advanced technology-they apparently didn't devastate it so thoroughly as to cause a major die-off of the human population. instead, they were able to support themselves by adopting new methods of food production. it's not clear that their economy could be called stable, since they changed it repeatedly over the next 2 ,000 years until significant european intervention occurred around 1900 ad. but they didn't suffer economic collapse. the tikopians moreover seem to have achieved something analogous to the ""world peace"" considered in part ii of chapter two-though it was not entirely stable, as we'll point out in a moment. to the extent that it was stable, its stability can be attributed to the fact that tikopian society was neither highly complex nor tightly coupled, and was not ""rich"" enough (in the sense of proposition 1 of chapter two) so that new self-prop systems would frequently arise to challenge the island's dominant self-prop systems. the total population of the island was only about 1,300, and within a culturally uniform population of that size we wouldn't necessarily expect any new, strong, aggressive self-propagating human groups to arise within any reasonable period of time. even so, the tikopian ""world peace"" was not so stable as to prevent all destructive competition: on at least two occasions there were wars in which entire clans were exterminated. because the tikopians fought only with primitive weapons (bows and arrows, etc.), their wars damaged only the tikopians themselves and not their environment. we can imagine what would have happened if they had had advanced technology to fight their wars with; most of us have seen photographs of world war i battlefields ravaged by high-explosive shells, whole forests torn to shreds and so forth. of course, it's highly unlikely that an island the size oftikopia could have the mineral resources to sustain an advanced technology. but if it did, then even nonviolent economic competition-even just mining activities alone-would have been enough to ruin the island. thus the example of tikopia does not undercut the theory developed in chapter two. because the islanders lacked advanced technology, and because their society was neither highly complex nor tightly coupled and was not ""rich"" enough to ensure the frequent emergence (under proposition 1 of chapter two) of vigorous new self-prop systems, tikopia did not satisfy the conditions for the theory to be applicable. appendix three stay on target what follows is a heavily rewritten excerpt from a letter to the editorin-chief of the john jay sentinel, a student newspaper at the john jay college of criminal justice. in its original form the letter was published in the march 2011 and april 2011 issues of the sentinel. the editor had correctly pointed out that economic competition under capitalism encouraged the development of technology, and he asked me whether it would therefore be worthwhile to spend time and effort on eliminating capitalism. here is my answer: those of us who believe that the technological system is an evil are often tempted to attack some of the subordinate evils that are associated with it, such as capitalism, globalization, centralization, bureaucracy, big, intrusive governments, environmental recklessness, and gross economic inequality. this temptation should be resisted. one may, of course, use evils like those i've listed as tools to attack the technological system",30.02

(we are guilty of oversimplification in paragraphs 80-82 because we have assumed that the desire for material acquisition is entirely a creation of the advertising and marketing industry. of course it’s not that simple. some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves with a powerful organization or mass movement. an individual lacking goals or power joins a movement or an organization, adopts its goals as his own, then works toward those goals. when some of the goals are attained, the individual, even though his personal efforts have played only an insignificant part in the attainment of the goals, feels (through his identification with the movement or organization) as if he had gone through the power process. this phenomenon was exploited by the fascists, nazis and communists. our society uses it too, though less crudely. example: manuel noriega was an irritant to the u.s. (goal: punish noriega). the u.s. invaded panama (effort) and punished noriega (attainment of goal). thus the u.s. went through the power process and many americans, because of their identification with the u.s., experienced the power process vicariously. hence the widespread public approval of the panama invasion; it gave people a sense of power. we see the same phenomenon in armies, corporations, political parties, humanitarian organizations, religious or ideological movements. in particular, leftist movements tend to attract people who are seeking to satisfy their need for power. but for most people identification with a large organization or a mass movement does not fully satisfy the need for power. another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is through surrogate activities. as we explained in paragraphs 38-40, a surrogate activity is an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that the individual pursues for the sake of the “fulfillment” that he gets from pursuing the goal, not because he needs to attain the goal itself. for instance, there is no practical motive for building enormous muscles, hitting a little ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage stamps. yet many people in our society devote themselves with passion to bodybuilding, golf or stamp-collecting. some people are more “other-directed” than others, and therefore will more readily attach importance to a surrogate activity simply because the people around them treat it as important or because society tells them it is important. that is why some people get very serious about essentially trivial activities such as sports, or bridge, or chess, or arcane scholarly pursuits, whereas others who are more clear-sighted never see these things as anything but the surrogate activities that they are, and consequently never attach enough importance to them to satisfy their need for the power process in that way. it only remains to point out that in many cases a person’s way of earning a living is also a surrogate activity. not a pure surrogate activity, since part of the motive for the activity is to gain the physical necessities and (for some people) social status and the luxuries that advertising makes them want. but many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary to earn whatever money and status they require, and this extra effort constitutes a surrogate activity. this extra effort, together with the emotional investment that accompanies it, is one of the most potent forces acting toward the continual development and perfecting of the system, with negative consequences for individual freedom (see paragraph 131). especially, for the most creative scientists and engineers, work tends to be largely a surrogate activity. this point is so important that it deserves a separate discussion, which we shall give in a moment (paragraphs 87-92). in this section we have explained how many people in modern society do satisfy their need for the power process to a greater or lesser extent. but we think that for the majority of people the need for the power process is not fully satisfied. in the first place, those who have an insatiable drive for status, or who get firmly “hooked” on a surrogate activity, or who identify strongly enough with a movement or organization to satisfy their need for power in that way, are exceptional personalities. others are not fully satisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an organization (see paragraphs 41, 64). in the second place, too much control is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through socialization, which results in a deficiency of autonomy, and in frustration due to the impossibility of attaining certain goals and the necessity of restraining too many impulses. but even if most people in industrial-technological society were well satisfied, we (fc) would still be opposed to that form of society, because (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one’s need for the power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an organization, rather than through pursuit of real goals. science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities. some scientists claim that they are motivated by “curiosity” or by a desire to “benefit humanity.” but it is easy to see that neither of these can be the principal motive of most scientists. as for “curiosity,” that notion is simply absurd. most scientists work on highly specialized problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. for example, is an astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? of course not. only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a new species of beetle? no. that question is of interest only to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity. if the chemist and the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they wouldn’t give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles. suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist. in that case he would have been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. in any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. the “curiosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’t stand up. the “benefit of humanity” explanation doesn’t work any better. some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human race most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for example. some other areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities. yet scientists in these areas are just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop vaccines or study air pollution. consider the case of dr. edward teller, who had an obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclear power plants. did this involvement stem from a desire to benefit humanity? if so, then why didn’t dr. teller get emotional about other “humanitarian” causes? if he was such a humanitarian then why did he help to develop the h-bomb? as with many other scientific achievements, it is very much open to question whether nuclear power plants actually do benefit humanity. does the cheap electricity outweigh the accumulating waste and the risk of accidents? dr. teller saw only one side of the question. clearly his emotional involvement with nuclear power arose not from a desire to “benefit humanity” but from a personal fulfillment he got from his work and from seeing it put to practical use. the same is true of scientists generally. with possible rare exceptions, their motive is neither curiosity nor a desire to benefit humanity but the need to go through the power process: to have a",20.83

it must be for something as well as against something. the positive ideal that we propose is nature. that is, wilb nature: those aspects of the functioning of the earth and its living things that are independent of human management and free of human interference and control. and with wild nature we include human nature, by which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of chance, or free will, or god (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions). 184. nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. nature (that which is outside the power of the system) is the opposite of technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the system). most people will agree that nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. the radical environmentalists already hold an ideology that exalts nature and opposes technology. it is not necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any new kind of social order. nature takes care of itself: it was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society, and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature without doing it an excessive amount of damage. only with the industrial revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really devastating. to relieve the pressure on nature it is not necessary to create a special kind of social system, it is only necessary to get rid of industrial society. granted, this will not solve all problems. industrial society has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will take a very long time for the scars to heal. besides, even preindustrial societies can do significant damage to nature. nevertheless, getting rid of industrial society will accomplish a great deal. it will relieve the worst of the pressure on nature so that the scars can begin to heal. it will remove the capacity of organized society to keep increasing its control over nature (including human nature). whatever kind of society may exist after the demise of the industrial system, it is certain that most people will live close to nature, because in the absence of advanced technology there is no other way that people can live. to feed themselves they must be peasants, or herdsmen, or fishermen, or hunters, etc. and, generally speaking, local autonomy should tend to increase, because lack of advanced technology and rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments or other large organizations to control local communities. 185. as for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society — well, you can't eat your cake and have it too. to gain one thing you have to sacrifice another. 186. most people hate psychological conflict. for this reason they avoid doing any serious thinking about difficult social issues, and they like to have such issues presented to them in simple, black-and-white terms: this is all good and that is all bad. the revolutionary ideology should therefore be developed on two levels. 187. on the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. the object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. it is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in infl uencing others. these people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. this does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal, care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology. 188. on a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. but even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. however, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under. 189. prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side. history is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants. until the time comes for the final push toward revolution, the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. as for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people. 190. any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should be careful about what kind of confl ict one encourages. the line of confl ict should be drawn between the mass of the people and the power-holding elite of industrial society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business executives, government officials, etc.). it should not be drawn between the revolutionaries and the mass of the people. for example, it would be bad strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn americans for their habits of consumption. instead, the average american should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and marketing industry, which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he doesn't need and that is very poor compensation for his lost freedom. either approach is consistent with the facts. it is merely a matter of attitude whether you blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for allowing itself to be manipulated. as a matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the public. 191. one should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that between the power-holding elite (which wields technology) and the general public (over which technology exerts its power). for one thing, other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts (between power-elite and ordinary people, between technology and nature); for another thing, other confl icts may actually tend to encourage technologization, because each side in such a confl ict wants to use technological power to gain advantages over its adversary. 'ibis is clearly seen in rivalries between nations. it also appears in ethnic conflicts within nations. for example, in america many black leaders are anxious to gain power for african-americans by placing black individuals in the technological power- elite. itiey want there to be many black government officials, scientists, corporation executives and so",21.74

in the present chapter we've discussed only those reasons related to the dynamics of social movements as reflected in our five rules, but in chapters one and two, and elsewhere, we've described other very powerful reasons why solutions like those of glendinning, n aess, illich, mander et al can never be put into practice. the reader may well ask whether it is possible to conceive of any remedy at all for the problem of technology that would be consistent with the five rules. we think it is possible. to begin, let's follow mao's advice and ask what is the principal contradiction in the situation with which we are faced. the principal contradiction, clearly, is that between wild nature and the technological system. this suggests that the objective chosen should be that of ""killing"" the technological system as we've described previously. in other words, revolutionaries should aim to bring about the collapse of the system by any means necessary. rule (i): this objective is sufficiently clear, concrete, and simple to form the basis for an effective movement. rule (v): if a revolutionary movement once grew powerful enough to destroy the technological system in this way, it ought to be able to accomplish the destruction in a short time. destruction is easier by far than construction. rule (ii): if the system were thoroughly broken down the effect would be-at least for a long time-irreversible, because it would take several hundred years or more for a new technological system to develop. some people even believe that a technological system could never again be created on earth. rule (iv): a revolutionary movement aspiring to ""kill"" the technological system would need to find a way of preventing unsuitable persons from joining the movement. most likely the chief danger would come from people of leftist type (as defined in isaif) who attach themselves to ""causes"" indiscriminately. a movement could probably drive such people away by maintaining a continuous verbal and ideological attack on leftist beliefs, goals, and ideas. if that proved insufficient to repel leftists, or if other types of undesirables (e.g., rightists) were attracted to the movement, other means of keeping the movement ""pure"" would have to be found. rule (iii): the hard part would be the task of organizing people for practical action. we can't offer any formula or recipe for carrying out this task, but those who undertake such an effort will find their road less difficult if they apply the ideas and information provided in chapter four, which follows. chapter four strategic guidelines for an anti-tech movement force is the final arbiter, vigorous intervention is the keynote, and victory goes to those who have the courage and the discipline to see things through to the end. such a view is characteristic of groups which seek to catapult themselves out of obscurity into history when, as it seems to them, all the forces of society are arrayed in opposition. -philip selznick 1. no specific route to victory for an anti-tech movement can be laid out in advance. the movement will have to wait for opportunities that in due course will enable it to bring about the collapse of the technological system. the exact nature of the opportunities and the time of their arrival will in general be unpredictable, so the movement will have to prepare itself for successful exploitation on short notice of any and all such opportunities. first, the movement must build its own internal sources of power. it will have to create a strong, cohesive organization consisting of individuals who are absolutely committed to the elimination of the technological system. numbers will be a secondary consideration. a numerically small organization built of high-quality personnel will be far more effective than a much larger organization in which the majority of members are of mediocre quality. the organization will have to develop its understanding of the dynamics of social movements so that it will recognize opportunities when they arrive and will know how to exploit them. second, the movement must build power in relation to its social environment. it must win respect for its ideas, its vigor, its effectiveness. if it is widely feared and hated, so much the better; but it must earn for itself a reputation as the purest and most uncompromisingly revolutionary of all oppositional movements. thus it will be the movement to which many individuals will turn upon the arrival of a severe crisis in which people have become desperate and have lost all respect for and all confidence in the existing form of society. third, to help pave the way for this loss of respect and confidence, the movement should do what it can to undermine people's faith in the technological system. this is likely to be the lightest of the movement's burdens, because much of the work will be done without any effort on the part of the movement. for one thing, the system's own failures will help to undermine confidence in it. for another, the spoken and written words of disenchanted intellectuals, especially those concerned with environmental issues, will act (and are already acting) to break down people's confidence in the existing social order. very few of these intellectuals are potential revolutionaries, therefore an anti-tech movement should not support them directly. but the movement can promote the decline of confidence in the existing social order by calling attention to the pervasiveness and the irremediable character of the system's failures and by making the system look weak or vulnerable whenever possible. in this chapter we will try to fill in some of the details of the picture that is roughly sketched in the foregoing paragraphs. 2 . revolutions almost never are successfully planned out long in advance of their actual occurrence. this is merely one instance of the principle that specific historical events are, in general, unpredictable. irving horowitz correctly observed that revolutions are carried out either without a previous program of action, or even in direct violation of such a program, and herbert matthews noted that ""of all the revolutionary leaders of modern times, only hitler outlined his program and stuck to it."" revolutionaries have to proceed by trial and error, and by grasping (usually unforeseen) opportunities as they arise. as lenin put it: ""we often have to grope our way along .. . . who could ever make a gigantic revolution, knowing in advance how to carry it through to the end?"" in january 1917, lenin did not believe that any kind of revolution would be possible in russia during his own lifetime. he was able to make the bolsheviks masters of russia only because he had the acumen to recognize and exploit the unexpected opportunity presented by the february 1917 insurrection in st. petersburg. 3. major opportunities, however, may be a long time in coming; the revolutionary movement may have to lie in wait for them. this doesn't mean that the movement can afford to relax and take it easy. on the contrary, while it is waiting the movement must remain hard at work, not only to build its strength so that it will be able to take full advantage of opportunities when they arrive, but also because an inactive movement will die or shrink to an apathetic rump. if a movement's members are not kept occupied with purposeful work, most will lose interest and drift away. another reason why the movement must remain active is that it is not enough for revolutionaries to wait passively for opportunities; the opportunities may have to be created in part by the revolutionaries themselves. some serious failure of the existing social order will probably have to occur independently of anything the revolutionaries can do, but whether such a failure is severe enough to provide an opportunity for overthrow of the system may depend on previous revolutionary activity. in russia, for example, the underlying weakness of the tsarist regime was not caused by revolutionaries. but the opportunity for revolution was based on the regime's defeat in world war i, and revolutionary activity may have contributed to that defeat, for ""[i]n no other belligerent country were political conflicts waged as intensively during the war as in russia, preventing the effective mobilization of the rear."" later, it was the spontaneous and unexpected insurrection of the workers of st. petersburg that gave the bolsheviks their great opportunity, and that insurrection probably would have been no more than a disorganized and ineffective outburst of frustration if the bolsheviks had not previously indoctrinated the workers with marxist ideas, thus providing them with a theory and an ideal that made it possible for their insurrection to be purposeful, organized, and effective. 4. from section 2, above, it follows that a revolutionary movement has to be prepared to respond successfully to the unexpected. if a program of action is to cover any appreciable span of time, the movement must not be committed to it in such a way that the program cannot be altered or discarded as unforeseen developments may",25.0

(ii) if a member of the anti-tech organization can find a place on the editorial board of a radical environmentalist periodical (for instance, the earth first! journal), he will be able to influence the content of the periodical. if a majority of anti-tech people can be placed on the editorial board, they will be able in effect to take the periodical over, minimize its leftist content, and use it systematically for the propagation of anti-tech ideas. (iii) if an anti-tech organization decides to undertake action on an environmental issue as suggested in section 17 of this chapter, and if it has power and influence within radical environmentalist groups, then it should be able to secure support and cooperation from these groups in carrying out the action in question. (iv) in some cases the anti-tech revolutionaries may be able to take over a radical environmentalist group altogether and turn it into an antitech group. under these circumstances leftists can be expected to drift away from the group, and in their place the group will attract recruits who are predisposed to anti-tech. (v) work in radical environmentalist groups will provide anti-tech revolutionaries with valuable training and experience in leadership and organizational work. (vi) when an acute crisis of the system arrives, the power and influence that anti-tech revolutionaries wield within radical environmentalist groups will be useful in the effort to organize on a mass basis. none of this is inconsistent with the rule that the anti-tech movement must maintain clear lines of demarcation between itself and other radical movements. lenin's emphasis on such lines of demarcation did not prevent him from collaborating-when he found it useful-with leaders of groups whose programs were in conflict with that of his own group. of course, members of the anti-tech organization who are asked to work within radical environmentalist groups will have to be clearly aware of the importance of the lines of demarcation. they will need to understand that their purpose in working with radical environmentalists is solely to win advantages for anti-tech and not to promote any radical environmentalist goals that may be inconsistent with anti-tech goals. how can anti-tech revolutionaries get themselves into positions of power and influence in radical environmentalist groups? the most important way will be through the moral authority of hard work. in every organization which they seek to capture, the communists are the readiest volunteers, the most devoted committee workers, the most alert and active participants. in many groups, this is in itself sufficient to gain the leadership; it is almost always enough to justify candidacy [for leadership]. the [communists] in penetrating an organization . . . become the 'best workers' for whatever goals the organization seeks to attain. this approach can be supplemented with a technique that nelson mandela used with outstanding success to get and keep leadership of the anti-apartheid movement in south africa: he strictly controlled his emotions, rarely allowed himself to show anger, remained always calm, self-possessed, even-tempered. this kind of deportment wins respect and encourages others to look to an individual for leadership. among the andaman islanders, a potential chief was ""a young adult in the camp who possessed the virtues that attract even younger men to seek his company. he was usually a good hunter, generous, and, above all, even-tempered."" a revolutionary working in a radical environmentalist group won't need to conceal his anti-tech commitment. but for obvious reasons he must avoid pushing anti-tech ideas aggressively, and he must not show disrespect for radical environmentalists' ideas. if he argues in favor of anti-tech he must do so in a good-humored way, and if an ideological discussion becomes heated or angry he must withdraw from it. for the present this writer is not actually recommending that an antitech organization should use these methods to gain power and influence within the radical environmentalist movement. the leaders of an anti-tech organization will make that decision when the time comes, and they will take into account the resources of their organization, the opportunities available to it, and any other relevant factors. the point here is simply that the ideas outlined in this section are at least worthy of serious consideration, and that this writer would never have thought of those ideas if he hadn't studied selznick's book. this example shows how the histories and the techniques of past movements can be an important source of ideas for an anti-tech movement today. 30. a revolutionary organization will need a section or a committee devoted to studying technology and keeping up with technological developments, and not only for the purpose of attacking technology politically. the organization also needs to be able to apply technology for its own revolutionary purposes. it is well known that in the united states (and probably in most other countries) law-enforcement and intelligence agencies have long made use of wire-tapping-often illegally-to keep track of the plans and activities of politically suspect groups. but nowadays old-fashioned tapping of telephone lines is becoming obsolete and far more sophisticated eavesdropping techniques are available, along with such tools for spying as ubiquitous surveillance cameras, face-recognition technology, hummingbird-sized (perhaps even insect-sized) drones, and mind-reading machines. in the united states, eavesdropping or spying by a government agency, unless authorized by a court of law, violates the fourth amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches, and at least in some cases is illegal. but in all of the extensive legal research that this writer has conducted",24.59

(the foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man.) 71. people have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessarily frustrated in modern life, hence fall into group 3. one may become angry, but modern society cannot permit fighting. in many situations it does not even permit verbal aggression. when going somewhere one maybe in a hurry, or one may be in a mood to travel slowly, but one generally has no choice but to move with the fl ow of traffic and obey the traffic signals. one may want to do one's work in a different way, but usually one can work only according to the rules laid down by one's employer. in many other ways as well, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations (explicit or implicit) that frustrate many of his impulses and thus interfere with the power process. most of these regulations cannot be dispensed with, because they are necessary for the functioning of industrial society. 72. modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive. in matters that are irrelevant to the functioning of the system we can generally do what we please. we can believe in any religion we like (as long as it does not encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system). we can go to bed with anyone we like (as long as we practice ""safe sex""). we can do anything we like as long as it is unimportant. but in all important matters the system tends increasingly to regulate our behavior. 73. behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the government. control is of ten exercised through indirect coercion or through psychological pressure or manipulation, and by organizations other than the government, or by the system as a whole. most large organizations use some form of propaganda to manipulate public attitudes or behavior. propaganda is not limited to ""commercials"" and advertisements, and sometimes it is not even consciously intended as propaganda by the people who make it. for instance, the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of propaganda. an example of indirect coercion: there is no law that says we have to go to work every day and follow our employer's orders. legally there is nothing to prevent us from going to live in the wild like primitive people or from going into business for ourselves. but in practice there is very little wild country left, and there is room in the economy for only a limited number of small business owners. hence most of us can survive only as someone else's employee. 74. we suggest that modern man's obsession with longevity, and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process. the ""mid-life crisis"" also is such a symptom. so is the lack of interest in having children that is fairly common in modern society but almost unheard-of in primitive societies. 75. in primitive societies life is a succession of stages. 'die needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. a young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food. (in young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won't discuss that here.) this phase having been successf ully passed through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (in contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of ""fulfillment."" we suggest that the fulfi llment they need is adequate experience of the power process — with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) again, having successfully raised his children, going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. many modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. we argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. it is not the primitive man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. it is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life. 76. in response to the arguments of this section someone will say, ""society must find a way to give people the opportunity to go through the power process.""this won't work for those who need autonomy in the power process. for such people the value of the opportunity is destroyed by the very fact that society gives it to them. what they need is to find or make their own opportunities. as long as the system gives them their opportunities it still has them on a leash. to attain autonomy they must get off that leash. 77. not everyone in industrial-technological society suffers from psychological problems. some people even profess to be quite satisfied with society as it is. we now discuss some of the reasons why people differ so greatly in their response to modern society. 78. first, there doubtless are innate differences in the strength of the drive for power. individuals with a weak drive for power may have relatively little need",22.4

(yet until quite recently in human history most people got along very nicely with no other entertainment than that which each local community created for itself.) without the entertainment industry the system probably would not have been able to get away with putting as much stress-producing pressure on us as it does. assuming that industrial society survives, it is likely that technology will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behavior. it has been established beyond any rational doubt that human thought and behavior have a largely biological basis. as experimenters have demonstrated, feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the brain. memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can be brought to the surface by electrical stimulation. hallucinations can be induced or moods changed by drugs. there may or may not be an immaterial human soul, but if there is one it clearly is less powerful that the biological mechanisms of human behavior. for if that were not the case then researchers would not be able so easily to manipulate human feelings and behavior with drugs and electrical currents. it presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes inserted in their heads so that they could be controlled by the authorities. but the fact that human thoughts and feelings are so open to biological intervention shows that the problem of controlling human behavior is mainly a technical problem; a problem of neurons, hormones and complex molecules; the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific attack. given the outstanding record of our society in solving technical problems, it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances will be made in the control of human behavior. will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of human behavior? it certainly would if an attempt were made to introduce such control all at once. but since technological control will be introduced through a long sequence of small advances, there will be no rational and effective public resistance. (see paragraphs 127, 132, 153.) to those who think that all this sounds like science fiction, we point out that yesterday’s science fiction is today’s fact. the industrial revolution has radically altered man’s environment and way of life, and it is only to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been. but we have gotten ahead of our story. it is one thing to develop in the laboratory a series of psychological or biological techniques for manipulating human behavior and quite another to integrate these techniques into a functioning social system. the latter problem is the more difficult of the two. for example, while the techniques of educational psychology doubtless work quite well in the “lab schools” where they are developed, it is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout our educational system. we all know what many of our schools are like. the teachers are too busy taking knives and guns away from the kids to subject them to the latest techniques for making them into computer nerds. thus, in spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior, the system to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings. the people whose behavior is fairly well under the control of the system are those of the type that might be called “bourgeois.” but there are growing numbers of people who in one way or another are rebels against the system: welfare leaches, youth gangs, cultists. satanists, nazis, radical environmentalists, militiamen, etc. the system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival, among which the problems of human behavior are the most important. if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. otherwise it will break down. we think the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years. suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades. by that time it will have to have solved, or at least brought under control, the principal problems that confront it, in particular that of “socializing” human beings; that is, making people sufficiently docile so that heir behavior no longer threatens the system. that being accomplished, it does not appear that there would be any further obstacle to the development of technology, and it would presumably advance toward its logical conclusion, which is complete control over everything on earth, including human beings and all other important organisms. the system may become a unitary, monolithic organization, or it may be more or less fragmented and consist of a number of organizations coexisting in a relationship that includes elements of both cooperation and competition, just as today the government, the corporations and other large organizations both cooperate and compete with one another. human freedom mostly will have vanished, because individuals and small groups will be impotent vis-a-vis large organizations armed with super-technology and an arsenal of advanced psychological and biological tools for manipulating human beings, besides instruments of surveillance and physical coercion. only a small number of people will have any real power, and even these probably will have only very limited freedom, because their behavior too will be regulated; just as today our politicians and corporation executives can retain their positions of power only as long as their behavior remains within certain fairly narrow limits. don’t imagine that the systems will stop developing further techniques for controlling human beings and nature once the crisis of the next few decades is over and increasing control is no longer necessary for the system’s survival. on the contrary, once the hard times are over the system will increase its control over people and nature more rapidly, because it will no longer be hampered by difficulties of the kind that it is currently experiencing. survival is not the principal motive for extending control. as we explained in paragraphs 87-90, technicians and scientists carry on their work largely as a surrogate activity; that is, they satisfy their need for power by solving technical problems. they will continue to do this with unabated enthusiasm, and among the most interesting and challenging problems for them to solve will be those of understanding the human body and mind and intervening in their development. for the “good of humanity,” of course. but suppose on the other hand that the stresses of the coming decades prove to be too much for the system. if the system breaks down there may be a period of chaos, a “time of troubles” such as those that history has recorded at various epochs in the past.",25.86

they will have to be more useful in relation to the cost of maintaining them-in other words, they will have to provide a better cost-versus-benefit balance-than any non-human substitutes. this is a tall order, for humans are far more costly to maintain than machines are. it will be answered that many self-prop systems-governments, corporations, labor unions, etc.-do take care of numerous individuals who are utterly useless to them: old people, people with severe mental or physical disabilities, even criminals serving life sentences. but this is only because the systems in question still need the services of the majority of people in order to function. humans have been endowed by evolution with feelings of compassion, because hunting-and-gathering bands thrive best when their members show consideration for one another and help one another. as long as self-prop systems still need people, it would be to the systems' disadvantage to offend the compassionate feelings of the useful majority through ruthless treatment of the useless minority. more important than compassion, however, is the self-interest of human individuals: people would bitterly resent any system to which they belonged if they believed that when they grew old, or if they became disabled, they would be thrown on the trash-heap. but when all people have become useless, self-prop systems will find no advantage in taking care of anyone. the techies themselves insist that machines will soon surpass humans in intelligence. when that happens, people will be superfluous and natural selection will favor systems that eliminate them-if not abruptly, then in a series of stages so that the risk of rebellion will be minimized. even though the technological world-system still needs large numbers of people for the present, there are now more superfluous humans than there have been in the past because technology has replaced people in many jobs and is making inroads even into occupations formerly thought to require human intelligence. consequently, under the pressure of economic competition, the world's dominant self-prop systems are already allowing a certain degree of callousness to creep into their treatment of superfluous individuals. in the united states and europe, pensions and other benefits for retired, disabled, unemployed, and other unproductive persons are being substantially reduced; at least in the u. s., poverty is increasing; and these facts may well indicate the general trend of the future, though there will doubtless be ups and downs. it's important to understand that in order to make people superfluous, machines will not have to surpass them in general intelligence but only in certain specialized kinds of intelligence. for example, the machines will not have to create or understand art, music, or literature, they will not need the ability to carry on an intelligent, non-technical conversation (the ""turing test""), they will not have to exercise tact or understand human nature, because these skills will have no application if humans are to be eliminated anyway. to make humans superfluous, the machines will only need to outperform them in making the technical decisions that have to be made for the purpose of promoting the short-term survival and propagation of the dominant self-prop systems. so, even without going as far as the techies themselves do in assuming intelligence on the part of future machines, we still have to conclude that humans will become obsolete. immortality in the form (i)-the indefinite preservation of the human body as it exits today-is highly improbable. the techies of course will argue that even if the human body and brain as we know them become obsolete, immortality in the form (ii) can still be achieved: man-machine hybrids will permanently retain their usefulness, because by linking themselves with ever-more-powerful machines human beings (or what is left of them) will be able to remain competitive with pure machines. but man-machine hybrids will retain a biological component derived from human beings only as long as the human-derived biological component remains useful. when purely artificial components become available that provide a better cost-versus-benefit balance than human-derived biological components do, the latter will be discarded and the man-machine hybrids will lose their human aspect to become wholly artificial. even if the human-derived biological components are retained they will be purged, step by step, of the human qualities that detract from their usefulness. the self-prop systems to which the man-machine hybrids belong will have no need for such human weaknesses as love, compassion, ethical feelings, esthetic appreciation, or desire for freedom. human emotions in general will get in the way of the self-prop systems' utilization of the man-machine hybrids, so if the latter are to remain competitive they will have to be altered to remove their human emotions and replace these with other motivating forces. in short, even in the unlikely event that some biological remnants of the human race are preserved in the form of man-machine hybrids, these will be transformed into something totally alien to human beings as we know them today. the same applies to the hypothesized survival of human minds in ""uploaded"" form inside machines. the uploaded minds will not be tolerated indefinitely unless they remain useful (that is, more useful than any substitutes not derived from human beings), and in order to remain useful they will have to be transformed until they no longer have anything in common with the human minds that exist today. some techies may consider this acceptable. but their",30.0
