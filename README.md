This study aims to identify and measure stylistic differences found in the manifestos written and published by a convicted American domestic terrorist, Theodore Kaczynski. Three versions of his manifesto are examined: the original publication of 1995, the edited 2010 publication, and his own revision published in 2016. This data is all publicly available and was preprocessed by the authors of this study. Using various prominent techniques in computational stylistics and stylochronometry such as Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and Variability-based Nearest Neighbor Clustering, we demonstrate that, contrary to Kaczynskiâ€™s remarks on the 2010 version, there exist no observable stylistic differences between the original version of 1995 and the edited 2010 version, but rather between the original version (1995) and his own revision published in 2016. To support this claim, we implement statistical analyses on important linguistic features commonly used in forensic linguistics.
